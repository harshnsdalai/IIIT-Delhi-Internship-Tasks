has a wp version and a wp version xap in the same submission   the wp xap works only on wp and the wp xap works only for wp   sometimes the store gives the wrong wp xap version of my app to windows

only heading on it   reproducible on lumia cyan update   i always use this feature please fix asap   seems there is an issue with the sd card in wp preview   its getting annoying please fix this   i ve been working on an lob for my field of engineering civil structural   the point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls   and because the same app runs on tablets and pc s our engineers can work in the field come back to their office and continue working with the same data on their pc s   because of windows and windows phone universal app i am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well   all the saved and live data are saved on onedrive to allow roaming between the devices   but i ve found that windows phone file picker does not have access to onedrive and there is no futureaccesslist   this aspect alone prevents any adaptation of my app to the windows phone platform   please allow windows phone file folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist   also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt   otherwise it s not a real universal app   all the saved and live data are more   so far i have tried three different apps and i cannot access my pre windows phone photos   this needs fixing as a number priority   it would be nice to give developers the option put a payment on hold when they reach the appropriate threshold and have the option to put it on top of the next due payment when they reach the threshold after that   in wp dev preview theres a bug with the push service   when i m on mobile data connection i get all my notifications when i m on wifi there is no connection to the push server   no i found a workaround for myself when i turn off the mobile data connection manually the push over wifi works   but on wp gdr the system recognized automaticly wich connection i m using and turn the push service automaticly on cellular or on wifi   everytime it works with wp dev preview it doesn t   when i try to insert a new bank account i receive an error because there is a validation that the bank account should be in the same country of my account   i think this is not correct because using paypal i can receive money in another country but i don t want pay extra costs for paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account   please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account   there is another post that i voted because i can t change the country in my account   there is another post that i voted more   i did a report on in app purchases today and noticed that every line item shows an app version of which most certainly is not the case   make bing vision lens in the camera app pinnable to start for quick access again and or add it to the cortana screen to the left of the music search button perhaps   in windows phone we were able directly access facebook through the people hub   comment on photos write on walls without having to enter the facebook app   we were also able to switch between text messages and facebook messages on the fly   now with windows phone the app always has to open   on my lumia it takes significantly longer to do that now   it s slow   please bring back the simplicity and efficiency of windows phone   while i was building a web application i ve noticed that single page applications with this url http www contoso com # will display blank page and only a refresh will load the page again can you please check that   it would be great if you would add a remoteid to the calendars   appointments have a remoteid but calendars don t   it would be easier to sync calendars if they have a remoteid like appointments   when the application is unpublished by microsoft the reason in sent by email   when the email is not received like in my case the developer doesn t know the reason   however this can be easily fixed by writing it in dev center   in winrt the tilebrush class is missing the tilemode and view properties that are present in other frameworks like wpf and silverlight   please add these properties so that we can support image tiling properly   there are tons of requests for this over the past years   see this thread for an example http social msdn microsoft com forums windowsapps en us bb aa e d f a d bdbee a f windowsuixamlmediaimagebrush forum winappswithcsharp   the lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from tile attributes   to provide lockscreen text its necessary to use the widebackcontent attribute on the flip tile   but if you have generated a custom tile and or you don t want the tile to flip then you cannot use the lockscreen text feature   i m trying to use the api for contacts in the namespace windows applicationmodel contacts but it doesn t work as expected   first of all on windows phone i always get an ioexception when trying to call pickcontactasync   this is very strange since i was expecting to see at least contacts app to be launched seems there s some problem establishing the contract   i also checked the contacts permission was enabled on the package appxmanifest   on windows rt che call to the pickcontactasync works but i receive wrong data instaed for example firstname and lastname are both in firstname and lastname is empty the importantdates e g   birthday are always set to low values like but if i try to navigate the contacts through outlook com or contacts people app i can see the right values   maybe i m missing something but this api seems to be broken   on windows rt che call to the pickcontactasync works but i receive wrong data instaed for example firstname and lastname are both in firstname and lastname is more   although it is possible to define custom etw events and to generate those events the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events   the windows phone developer power tools only enable collection of predefined profiles that use certain system events   there appears to be no way to tell it to collect data from your own custom event sources   so although in e g net based store apps the system diagnostics tracing eventsource class is available and can be used to generate custom etw events there doesn t appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can t actually record those events in a trace   just to be clear this is not a duplicate of http wpdev uservoice com forums dev platform suggestions please provide etw logging from a windows phone as a reply in that thread points out you can already log etw events from a wp app   what i want is the ability to record those alongside system provided etw events so that i can see how my code s activity fits in with system behaviour   so although in e g net based store apps the system diagnostics tracing eventsource class is available and can be used to generate custom etw events there doesn t appear to be any point to this at the moment because you more   please get back the old onedrive integration to windows phone   it used to sync so fast and was able to view the pictures under photo albums easily   and now the app takes long time to load   the same happened with facebook integration   it used to be good on   we could minimize or maximize the pictures but now we can only maximize   i purchased the windows phone because of the smooth integration but now we are slowly moving towards apps and no os integration   microsoft provide a system event smsreceived for app to be notified when a sms received we also need such event for phone call such as phonereveived   moreover it s better to have read only api for phone call history so developer can help to make better phone call related app like android   make the mapicon of the windows phone sdk able to be on top by the use of zindex make the event tapped accessible for mapicon too   allow the messaging application to join in the default messaging application hub message for full interaction   applications use the api of the hub message for send view delete etc sms the message hub uses the api of others applications for the same thing send view delete etc messages   this means that the developper have the ablity to implement other application apis in the message hub and use it   we need windows phone to synchronize its clock via the internet   in some countries this does not work via provider services   include an api to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists tpl to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control   just like on desktop ie

resume   this has broken my app swipe tunes as i hastilly submitted a wp update with transparent tile and realised later that fast resume was causing issues with my secondary tiles etc   fast resume has pretty much killed my app and i can t delete the wp xap from the store and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the wp store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers   please cant we have an option in the wpappmanifest file to untick fast resume and allow wp apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in wp   http windowsphone uservoice com forums feature suggestions suggestions we want open the app by tap the quick status icon   allow nfc capable windows phones to pay from the wallet app using nfc at locations where card readers support it   google wallet has been able to do this for almost years now   just youtube using google wallet at mcd   support for this would destroy any argument for an apple device because they aren t going to do this any time soon and it would close the gap in functionality between wp and android   developers need create edit document from windows store apps   thereby integrate winrt apps with office   openxml sdk office for winrt office primary interop assembly classes for winrt win applications need to be more productive for businesses   microsoft pubcenter claims to have interstitials   however these are just bigger ad formats and not the interstitials we know from other ad networks   interstitials are displayed at a break point in the app game   therefore it is for the app game developer much more important to have a good fill rate   allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy   he is able to show his own house ad when pubcenter can not fill the ad request   provide access to cpu gpu data in c#   i style a part of the page in font style italic and see the font segoe ui is rendered in much bolder style than the rest of the page   see http social msdn microsoft com forums windowsapps en us c cbd ae ab a e e d cce segoe ui italic looks bold forum winappswithhtml for screenshots of this possible bug   i ve seen some suggestions that are close to what we need but not quite and are marked as completed   i don t know why there is no support for current devices to read nfc cards tags in full at a low level   seems deceptive to say that the device has nfc capabilities if in reality it can only read a very specific type of tag   for one of our products we need to support nfc card reading writing with existing devices and several types of cards mifare ul ulc calypso desfire maybe even more i ve read that for wp the functionality will be added but only for devices with a specific nfc chipset which is currently not present in any of the devices   so please provide the low level reading writing functionality for nfc devices already in the field   for one of our products we need to support nfc card reading writing with existing devices and several types of cards mifare ul ulc calypso desfire maybe even more i ve read that for wp the functionality will be more   it s supremely annoying while developing to have to go through the certification wait time just to add an in app purchase product to the dev center   i m not sure i can think of a reason that any certification is needed for these they re merely a price key and type   please remove the cert process for these and allow them to be added instantly   when porting my windows app to windows phone i feel that the universal app template which is already awesome could do some other things to increase even more productivity create pages and usercontrol folders let s face it unless we want to create sh apps we won t have the same ui for all platforms so we ll end up creating the same pages and controls in both versions   vs could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes pages and user controls from the original project   i have stated the folder names i use pages and usercontrols but the rule could deal with other names as well   i use settingsflyouts and i took some time to replicate them as pages in the windows phone project   that could be automatic too   likewise top and bottom app bars in windows could be translated into the windows phone versions automatically if for example buttons were found in those controls   do the same for styles xaml or whatever file contains templates and styles as done in   i believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken but i only remember these because i ported a very simple app   i recognize that when threshold arrives code matching between windows and windows phone achieves much of these may not matter anymore but for the time being these would be nice additions   i have stated the folder names i use pages more   i wished that pubcenter had a way of merging apps that i had in both platforms windows and windows phone which obviously includes universal apps   when using headphones music will pause if cortanta notifies you of an incoming text message   music will then continue to play once you respond to the notification   however podacasts do not pause and will continue to play inaudibly in the background as you interact with cortanta   this is a bug and should be fixed so that any media that is playing will be paused if you are interacting with cortanta   the trial feature should be built in with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the windows store   in the windows store i can choose trial mode for my app and then pick the number of days i want the trial to last   from there everything is taken care of for me   if the user uninstalls during a trial it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later   contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc   if the user uninstalls and installs again later the developer has no idea   adding trial mode in windows phone feels like implement and pray   i absolutely love the windows store implementation   with the two stores combining can we bring built in trial mode support to windows phone   contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days more   you should be able to start an app like the flashlight app directly from the notification center   please add recent places to suggestedstartlocation in fileopenpicker api   some times its hard to navigate few times to same location   please provide access to calendar api to customize the day styles basing upon requirement   it would be much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows windows phone   it is quite hard to find a solution to something you never heard about before but with the right pointers keywords it could be done efficiently and nearly effortlessly   as example for an obvious issue and easy solution if you know something about the problem my app failed certification because of dark light theme problems   i set the background to a fixed color black in the code and in the light theme the font color is set from white to black by windows phone automatically hence no text is readable   this problem occured at multiple tens of code places in my case   adding the following four lines to a report that probably has been sent out thousands of times would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading this might help with dark light theme problems visibility application current resources phonedarkthemevisibility or similar brush application current resources phonebackgroundbrush and maybe additional links to documentation it would be much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows windows phone   i set the background to a fixed color black more   closes alone than nothing   implementing

when creating an app that uses mediastreamsource to stream audio in windows phone everything works just great   when porting this app to windows phone the sound is flickering and its components are stack overflow ing   here is a discussion on msdn forums http social msdn microsoft com forums wpapps en us ac ed fae b mediastreamsource not working properly in windows phone forum wpdevelop and here is a sample project source code https wp libflac codeplex com   we are publishing the same apps in windows phone store and windows app store   now we want to bundle these apps   unfortunately we are not able to set the prices in both marketplace same way   in windows app store we can choose the price tier   for all countries prices are automatically set   in windows phone store we are able to set the price for each county separately   we need this also in windows app store because   exchange rate between us and is too low   the rate is set to   because we calculate our prices in we have to change the price for all countries with manually and there are a lot of countries to change   we are not willing to charge less in us or canada than in europe   change exchange rate between argentina

billing and not to credit card transactions in windows phone store we are publishing the same apps in windows phone store and windows app store   because we calculate our prices in we more   currently it is not possible to change the package identity name of an app once it has been published which is a bit frustrating   users don t like to wait when they click on app   splash screen for app is making my consumers wait for actual screens to load   this gives them impression that my app is slow   i think microsoft needs to re consider about having splash screens   when users click on app they should directly see ui no lags   let normal http uris to be able to send notifications to the app using the window external notify and not only the https uris   give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the scriptnotify event or not   extend the mediaelement to support youtube videos so simple   most probably you will have to collaborate with google but this is the challenge   unleash the developers power the store is going to win   this bug is easy to reproduce var wbmp new writeablebitmap await wbmp setsourceasync stream the stream comes from a picture with larger size i e   x now check the properties of wbmp pixelwidth pixelheight pixelbuffer length the length of pixelbuffer is totally wrong the buffer size shoud be x x the wrong value comes from the original size x x   i think this is a bug because i think if the writeablebitmap decides to update the pixelwidth and pixelheight property it should also update the pixelbuffer or the data is inconsistent   the era of connected tv is here   windows developers need apis to control tv tuners and display of other digital media on the same screen at the same time   make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing   you can limit number of apps according to the screen size   provide an api to use cortana services within apps as well as provide implementable interface s which expose app services to cortana then cortana can call these methods and developers worldwide can extends it s functionality   please add api s for sharing to

universal app model does not provide this functionality   this should be added in future versions as it is still an important feature for some apps   windows phone introduces the social extensibility framework   it allows third party apps to integrate into the people hub s what s new feed etc   currently this integration is locked and only select app developers are given access   the documentation on the windows phone socialintegration namespace is also limited   i would like microsoft to open up this framework to all developers   i understand this framework is still being developed and real word usage must first be measured   but why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators   i think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenario s for using this framework   i think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenario s for more   i have create and export from my projects the win app and with the instructions you provide into your site i m trying to install the app to win   the cert   is installed successfully   but when i m trying to install the app i m getting an error   storeapp appstudio windows anycpu appx   would allow binding to isvisible in an mvvm scenario   possibly some other property named parent to choose where popup is revealed from   again suitable for mvvm   i d like to record an audio video file while playing a audio file in the background   the reason i got into this is because i figured if any company could do it microsoft could and then i find out that i can t   now my killer app has to wait for windows to catch up again   i don t know if you have to have two sets of speakers or two microphones or a way to separate left speaker from right but it would make a whole lot of devs happy to be able to do this   it is more convenient to go with swiping gestures is more fun being with than the tap method   however there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods   to set a difference a swipe to the right should launch settings menu as a swipe to the left launches the apps list   currently i m developing an app for posting photos to a user s picasa account   a user has requested that the app provide functionality to edit a given photo from their account and upload a new version   i don t think it s best of my resources to implement this functionality when there are so many great photo editing apps already on the market   i would like the ability to pass the photo from my app to an app of the user s choice via an app picker that supports the selected photo type   the user can then do some function within the selected app e g   add a filter crop etc and then the opened app can pass that edited file back to my app   this would extend the power already available with share pickers to perform more generic tasks and would result in a better experience for the user   all this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the os has   this should be available both in winrt and silverlight applications   the user can then do some function within the selected app more   a thing that would be increbible is that your phone make a sound when you whistle or clap hands a certain pattern wich could be preseted by the phone owner so when you can t find your phone and you dont have a buddy around to text you you can find it   lockscreen should be able to chose a tiny black outline around lettering so you can see what s written properly when you have a clear white lock screen   should be able to put transparent saved in pgn lockscreens like wp notification center should be able to control the screen when notification center is half open   should be able to control music play pause next previous song info directly from the notification center   xbox music should be able to swap music player sideways   pictures needs to open on albums instead of all the pictures mail center would be awesome if it opened on a page where you have a seperate for each of your accounts   then you chose with one to open   should be able to put transparent saved in pgn lockscreens like wp notification center should be able to control the screen more   could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment   companies need to have the correct sales estimate for the accounts purposes   windows sdk brought a lot of built in transitions making easier to develop a native like app   but i m missing that list animations seen on settings or messaging apps when opening or closing them   there are properties like isstaggeringenabled and isstaggerelement in the commonnavigationinfo class but the animations doesn t feel like the native one   thanks and keep up the good work with windows phone   make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper representing application high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui now many apps has simply ugly icons pixelated android like pirated misleading   many times apps games were made free for limited time as offers promotions   but we users misses out need a category showing apps gone free price change limited time offers like red stripe deals   ie in wp with all updates gives error doesn t load page if the body tag contains onload window location function i e   onload window location #april   tried backup and restore yesterday   it seems wp does not backup and then restore all the apps   mostly nokia s and here s apps some examples nokia camera here maps here drive were not backed up   i needed to install these manually   some other nokia apps that were installed by default when i bought the phone photo and video related apps were not restored either   also after i restored the phone here maps and here drive tiles had   sign and saying that these apps do not even exist in the store any more   but of course they exist in the store   i installed these manually later   some of my contact had different than default ringtone   those were not restored either   all contacts had the same ringtone   glance screen settings and when it goes to night mode were not backed up and restored   but of course they exist in the store more   i recently had to use this api for a private client certificate   and i was surprised to read in the msdn that it returns nothing as a result of its async call   i would really have thought it returns the just imported pfx   so here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this api change would help to improve the code flow var clientcert ensurecertficatesasync

used to be and hardware extensions are starting to appear like the structure sensor which is designed to work with iphone and android   since umdf usb drivers are absolutely safe from harming the

process by being able to upload an app submission as a single archive package per submission   this archive could be a zip file should contain all of the meta data could be as an xml file and supporting files e g xap screenshots etc   that the store team needs to ingest the app and provide it to the store   apple provides a similar capability via itunes connect https developer apple com library mac documentation languagesutilities conceptual itunesconnect guide addingnewapps addingnewapps html   this capability would not only enhance the submission experience but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in the developer s source control system e g tfs git   optionally it would also be great for this capability to support selection of markets and price points that the app is intended to target   as a starting point it would be fine for the developer to download from the dev center a starter template that is a zip file with basic xml templates and placeholder filenames which the developer could then tweak modify for the app she wants to submit   this capability would not only enhance the submission experience but it would also allow for store submissions to be added and tracked in more   i want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by dpe east africa   there is alot of unequal favoritism going on with regards to developer support on issues like windows testing devices   certain people request for devices and get immediately   unequal judging process based on friendship merits rather than app quality   any one here can see its down right nepotistic   i launch this complaint on behalf of others and in good faith   kindly i urge you to look at this matter   thanks in advance   support the windows media editing api on windows   currently it is supported on windows phone only   change the cellular sim back to auto switch to wifi as preferred network the new manual data connection management is very annoying and result in hi data usage on the cellular network   http stack will help us to write complete web server inside phone that could be use for hosting webpage downloading files from phone via browser etc   you should be able to select a default application for certain functions   for instance i click a hyperlinked phone number and i am given the option to call with the phone or skype   i would like to be able to tell the system to always open with skype   same for maps youtube links website links that also have an app etc   currently a file is simply flagged as deleted   the file is not removed from storage   in todays criminal government spy world simply flagging a file as deleted does not secure it from prying eyes   please consider adding an option to erase a file by overwriting the bits with garbage and also the catalog entry file name   the actual erasure can be a background process   also consider adding a group policy to enforce erasure   hey please please make the classes in above framework like songcollection playlists etc immutable and unabstract   right now its impossible to create a custom playlist in a media player app without transferring all the songs to iso   it will be very easy if the classes are immutable and song collection class can be used simply as a list where one can add or remove song just like other collections so that mediaplayer play songcollection coll can be used more effectively   further extend background agent player to play not only audio tracks but song as well thanks   i have problems with contact class on windows and

wrong and why it goes wrong   platforms like ios and android now feature means to debug your webview via the desktopbrowser   when you connect an iphone to a mac you can view the webview from safari by going to develop debug   and voor android devices you open chrome and go to about devices   this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong and with ie a lot can go wrong ie is better but still not as easy to make cross platform apps run like on android and ios   having the means to inspect your app or site needs to be improved greatly   you can now only see the console but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn t show errors not even the dom   let alone inspect resources timeline and html css javascript errors   with frameworks like angular node jquery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience   this gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong and more   currently apps can be transferred between accounts retaining i believe all ratings users app id etc   this can be done through a support ticket   however apps with in app purchases are not eligible to be transferred   not even if the iaps are completely removed from the app and deleted from the developer account   if the app ever had an iap it is not eligible for transfer   i understand why this might not have been a high priority but as the platform grows it seems absolutely necessary   i have apps i would like to transfer which had iaps but i cannot do so   the reason i removed the iaps was to make the apps eligible for transfer   quite unfortunate   reasons to transfer an app transfer ownership to a different person or group ex an app is purchased by a different company   ideally it would be great to transfer an app including its iaps all intact   logistically i can imagine the nightmare that might be   at the very least if iaps are removed from the app and deleted from the dev account the app should become transferable   i have apps i would like to transfer which had iaps but i cannot do more   the copyfolderasync

all the existing credibility and market is lost   app is in store with current policies at that time there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff   when you are developing an app the generic policies will make sense   but when a developer submitted an app and it s failing for a reason policies it s worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his her app   what are the things went wrong rather than saying your app failing on it s generic message will be no use as the app is already developed reading these policies and with the understanding of these policies   if you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times it will be frustrating   after a little while developer may think that anyway they are not going thru what s the point in spending time here   be responsible and give more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things   may be this works with a firm company but for independent developers you are the source you are the helper   if you simply say an app failed with the policy number or so what can a developer benefit out of it rather he will be more more   windows phone default calculator is annoying without being able to copy and paste numbers into the

be convinient if the copyandreplaceasync method would return something similar to the copyasync method   namely the file that was replaced   it would make chaining additional operations much more easier   having to re enter things like version number application name etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes   in the app manifest i ve already put the version number and

example how this should work   in every communication emails the support officer s manager and generic escalation emails are included   please do the same for windows phone store unless you want to leave the developers and therefore the end users let down because of sub pair support quality   microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands

second my own internal code which should be typed after a long time of phone inactivity   i noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone i can skip sim code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code in about cases sim code panel will pop up but in the other no   i can use all phone features except calling but getting access to other data is terrifying too   i checked it a few times   so my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only sim code   and what may cause that phenomenon   i noticed that after the reboot of my mobile phone i can skip sim code simply by pulling the screen down like clsing an app and then i only need to type my internal code more   currently windows phone is very restricted for developers   it is not at all flexible   whatsapp cant send audios truecaller cant interpret incoming calls we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too   all this is because of a simple reason security which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there   they shouldn t be restricted like this   so please develop two variants of windows phone os   enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible more open for users and developers   make sd boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error   start button for notification light calls msg all notification   when using mapelement derived controls such as mappolygon expose a tap event   in the event arguments allow some type of identification of the backing object such as the tag property   or don t make these objects sealed so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves   wp need to provide api s that allow developers to develop apps like app locker that locks specific apps using phone with lock not enough   hi please add the from to options right after download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails   due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night   it s extremely annoying   even my old phone nokia e running on symbian had an opportunity to specify the time period during which new emails will be checked   the new geolocator api and implementation is so unreliable that it can t be used with any confidence in a product   problems i have encountered while using positionchanged event geolocator reportinterval seems to be ignored   the simulator does a reasonable job of honouring the reporting interval phones seem to ignore it completely e g   reportinterval set to second the phone would regularly take seconds and sometimes minutes to report   as a developer i expect the reportinterval to be honoured with a high degree of accuracy   if the phone doesn t have an accurate location simply return what it does have   getpositionasync and getgeopositionasync timespan timespan regularly never return   because the event based location reporting is unreliable i have tried to use these apis instead unfortunately they are also unreliable   the getgeopositionasync method will work maybe times in a row and then simply stop working and never return despite having a timeout parameter   in general the api is poorly designed   changing properties on an active gelocator causes exceptions   getting the geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers i e   the api is too implicit it works on side effect rather than deliberate commands   if the phone doesn t have an accurate location simply return what it does more   while i was trying to generate the project from the app studio it just hung   it is showing the status generating for the past hour   the online media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos   currently the sorting is albums title acsending pictures albums creationtimestamp acesending it would be good if there was more sorting either via the photo hub or via code which allows all items to be sorted title creation timestamp last updated timestamp ascending descending   hi forcing all wp apps upgraded to wp to behave differently on resume is causing me massive headaches   pleas allow in the wmappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my wp app can function just as it did in wp   please   thanks   selecting apps updated message in windows phone notification center should jump directly to app download history instead of jumping to the store app but not showing the history   currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history after apps updated was selected in notification center expand menu bar select downloads swipe to history   please provide a quick menu for windows phone something comparable to win x menu in windows but with possibility to edit and add menu items by the user   the menu should be triggered by press and holding the standard windows key   that key combination is still free and the most logical place for a quick menu   make it possible to choose different sounds for different apps   example   whatsapp and other apps use the default sound   all other messages   for example app submission certification gives you there was a problem processing this request   please try again after a few minutes in firefox   it worked in ie then   it either does not play the short sound effect or plays it seconds too late   i then used sharpdx for my app   i also couldn t create a mediaelement in codebehind because it needs a strange path for phones and throws an exception   hey i thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their internet explorer for their wp like they would on a desktop pc   as an app publisher in south africa i am currently unable to get any sort of proper tax invoice for purchases made through my developer account   this makes me incredibly unpopular with my accountant   would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me   currently ms only seems to send snail mail invoices and only to certain countries way to go in leading the way with technology in business   anyway im sure that im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great   because i receive a lot of spam flashsms which i delete immediately i need a possibility to add phone numbers to blocked list manually   i cannot pick the number from unanswered calls or somewhere else because those numbers are not stored in my phone   hi currently wp allows to backup images so that low quality via data or high quality via wifi   for security reasons i d really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete s the resized photo from the phone   then when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud too   how s that for security   lets assume the phone is set not to automatically connect every available wifi network or there is no free wifi available   if the phone is stolen and it is password locked it s still possible to take photos if enabled   the thief may take a photo but if only the wifi backup option is enabled but there is no wifi available for the phone then the picture stays in the phone   but if it were possible to automatically resize the image in the phone and upload it via data then it would be available for the phone s real owner   the thief could take a picture of him herself then it can be given to police and or give idea of his her location   then when the phone finds wifi and is able to connect it back up the original high quality picture and deletes the resized photo from the cloud more   please add the possibility to open html files that are located in the folders in the phone s memory   lumia running on wp with all the updates has extremely bad gsm both g and g signal reception   my previous phone nokia e with the same uncut sim card had full bars then my l has only sometime

applications   i would like to get short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on lockscreen   just like stardock s deskscapes for windows pc s   you get to choose what video you like and it plays over and over again the trick is to not notice the end and the start of the video easiest to do on waterfall videos   i hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earth wind

example and return back after that   open up to more platforms to make this phone actually works with the project my phone feature   i understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from   e g   a german review should only be shown in germany and maybe in switzerland and austria   what i don t understand is that you also showing the app rating in countries were they come from   for example an app has ratings   from germany all with stars from usa star and from france stars if you now open the app in the windows phone store from germany you will see a total app review rating of stars   if you open the app in the us windows phone store it shows only rating with star   in france it shows ratings with stars and in all other countries it shows ratings   the total rating should be equal worldwide   i understand that it makes sense to only show app reviews only in those countrys were they come from   from germany all with stars from usa star and from france stars if you now open the app in the windows phone store from germany you will see a total app review rating of more   setting time for a new reminder in the calendar app is not possible   always resets to   german localization   right now it is very difficult and completely undocumented to determine if a photo or picture is marked as a favorite by a user or to retrieve a list of favorites similar to getting the list of pictures in the knownfolders cameraroll etc   if a user has taken the time to mark pictures as favorites we should celebrate that and make it simple for developers to use that in their own applications   when you use the photochoosertask and specify a pixelwidth and pixelheight when an image is chosen the user is provided with a cropping tool that is outstanding and difficult to duplicate   please provide a photocroptask that takes an image byte and provides the same crop tool   include a pixelheight and pixelwidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included   microsoft should do approach with developer aplication service and makers of office space in order to them to make the aplication run on windows phone for all brand nokia htc samsung etc   i understand you have security considerations to consider however i cannot think of any reason we should not be able to check if a sms is received   extend the schedulednotification recurrencetype options beyond daily weekly monthly endofmonth yearly to allow more options for example every days every weeks every quarter every month etc   maybe by having a frequency parameter so for each of the existing recurrencetype types i e   frequency for every days frequency for every weeks etc     the new way to move the cursor with the finger to edit a word is terrible in win   please come back with previous solution   why doesn t wp create albums   i thought the ability to create albums in photos would really help users be more organized in storing their

bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right   the bottom could be quick links while the top or left side could be used for navigational purposes   please combine all windows phone skds into one installation file so people download only one file and then check each version of wp sdks that they want to install   it will help to reduce misunderstandings   like android and ios right now most of the people confused and built app compatible with wp instead of wp   hi i think it s useful if both windows phone x and windows x will have a similar way to access filesystem

support similar filters   these properties will allow developers to introduce many useful features such as auto playlists and it ll also help xbox team to bring back recently added feature   full unsafe code support would allow more code to be shared across platforms and increase the performance of applications that needed it   here s a use case example i m the author of bepuphysics a real time simulation library   i wish to support many platforms as best i can with as much common code as possible   unfortunately in the current situation i can t have the best of both worlds   if my goal is optimal performance i must maintain separate codebases for a bunch of low level queries and data structures   on the other hand if my goal is as much common code as possible i m forced to use the suboptimal lowest common denominator crippling all of the other platforms   over time these competing motivations have resulted in a codebase that is harder to maintain yet still isn t as fast as it could be   while using c could provide the necessary access and performance many of the potential uses in simulation are sufficiently fine grained that dropping to c from c# repeatedly is at best horribly messy and at worst actually slower   a full native implementation would address the performance side of things but i can t justify the massive expense of porting for just one platform   it would also destroy a lot of value for the c# based users of the library   even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn t allow unsafe code enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the pc   this would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone   on the other hand if my goal is as much common code more   when in a busy place cortano doesn t understand anything   please improve that   i often fiddle with the price of the in app purchase iap in my wp app to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and #of purchases   at present i have to manually record when i change the price as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported excel file   ideally i would like to see a graph with both #of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of purchase vs price   ideally i would like to see a graph with both #of purchases and purchase price plotted against time this would allow me to quickly see a change in rate of

navigation system app is must on windows phone   i am liking windows phone that i bought a couple of days ago but if i can t use the phone as my gps navigation while driving it s not good for me   it is best if photos can be processed on onedrive   the photo app on windows is not nearly good enough   i have an image x with file size kb and it does not load   load error   in the app dev archive the photos are x   hence some reasonable feature should be implemented on app studio onedrive to make this possible   i cannot get directions for transit and walk but for drive in the maps for wp   also it is pretty slow   currently the windows phone sdk installs all the components within the sdk including the emulator   however not all devices are compatible and the emulator images take up a large amounts of space and take lengthy times to download   users without compatible hardware are forced to download an unnecessary portion of the sdk without the ability to skip this feature   as such please make the installation of the sdk optional during the sdk installation   tile can show s video   manage my total apps purchase by deleting the unwanted apps from the total list similar like

delete   on windows phone the store bug when we open the store applications list coudn t load   the store is unusable   windowsphone   allow apps to download data like pocket for offline viewing   in some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class   there must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps   the sd card support in wp is practically useless because built in apps are the only ones allowed to access what are known as reserved file and uri associations   http msdn microsoft com en us library windowsphone develop jj v vs aspx this means it is impossible to create an app that plays video or audio files stored on the sd card   many wp devices ship with only gb which makes the use of the sd card essential especially to store large files such as video   we are presently working on a wp version of an app to play sign language videos but are stymied by this restriction   we cannot read or even see any mp files on the sd card   this limitation basically stops our project for wp   of course we have ios and android versions that work on phones   our own project aside it seems somewhat draconian to disallow any third party apps from competing with the built in apps   just looking at the list of reserved file types seems like all file types known to man are reserved   and then i remind myself that this is just on the sd card   but then what is the point of the sd card if the developer is restricted to the phone s internal memory   we cannot read more   there is ssl tls socket support in windows phone   however currently no wp platform component seems to support ssl certificate pinning   when a ssl connection is created there is no way to inspect the x certificate chain returned by the remote server   i want to implement certificate pinning for additional security in my app and therefore i need an api to read the values of individual x certificates   i am not the only one who needs this http stackoverflow com questions read ssl certificate details on wp please provide a way to do certificate pinning using platform components in wp   this is third time i am stuck in windows phone app development because windows phone doesn t provide a good background service   running of background service just for seconds every minutes is restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients   my client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running which we successfully implemented in android and ios   but because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for their product   so what i suggest is give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will be running and battery consumption it might cause and then user can decide to install the app or not   but because of the restriction in windows phone development over background service client is on the verge of dropping windows phone app for more   few days before updating the latest windows app studio i can still install into my phone   but after this new version and generation into wp and w i manage once with success installation but now can t be installed and always asked for install from store   it will be great if app can access files in documents dir   currently app can only access them through office   that made all document viewing editing app has a terrible user experience   and user may not understand how to open some type of files   if the microsoft force users to use office or force developers to use skydrive by this way may take the opposite result and lost users and developers   it would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar   however if the user closes the app during these processes the data might be corrupted   or for instance we are in a setup wizard we don t want the user to be able to close the app until the user has finished the setup   error report   i created my app in windows phone app studio   i choose in my phone the white theme and i see a problem the hidden

cellular service like gsm monitor are not currently supported due to lack of an api to support the raw cellular data in real time   would be good if some of these tools could be developed by the support of cellular data in the network api   simply like in a windows   have an api for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background   one possible use case a smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet   for the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone maybe timed maybe because user presses a button on the phone to send a request which the service on the phone then handles some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved the actual trigger from device to phone could be done with bluetooth le if listening for incomming spp connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories   not being able to compile shaders at runtime is a huge inconvenience and prevents projects like angle from producing a fully compliant opengl port   please provide a api to get the signal strength of a particular bluetooth device so that we can estimate the distance between windows phone and the device   this can help us implement positioning in a small aera which just like what apple ibeacon does   it s interesting and useful   silverlight doesn t work properly in ie so i cannot upload xap files using ie   i have to switch to google chrome to publish windows phone apps   i get the following message you don t have a supported version of silverlight installed   to get the latest version   if i try to update silverlight i recieve the message the same version is already installed   silverlight is enabled etc   application that will silence ringer between set hours but allow exceptions by contact and silence ringer during scheduled meetings from my linked calendars outlook com google com yahoo com etc   it looks like instances of audiovideocapturedevice automatically dispose when an app is deactivated   the disposal appears to be done in the runtime code as none of my disposal code runs in these situations   this is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and activatedeventargsisapplicationinstancepreserved true because all application memory should be intact   but it isn t because the audiovideocapturedevice instance has been auto magically disposed   this can be difficult to detect if the device is used in a deeply embedded object   my idea is that you are using tour own agenda and then notice the poor synchronising performance of it with google agenda   with other words it sucks   allow custom uri s in internet explorer like nabto device company net   basically implement the iinternetprotocol family of com interfaces on windows phone and allow us to add our own protocol handlers in the registry it is possible on windows   batterymanager should provide mechanism to tell us whether phone is plugged in ac or using usb   right now it only tells me whether the battery source is external or battery but external is too generic   it ll be great to have batterysource usb and batterysource ac when plugged in and batterysource battery when not plugged in   i recently asked myself how long an app takes to get in the store   especially if there are deadlines to fulfill it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified   all other steps are working really smooth but the pending certification is taking up to days without showing any progress   is there a way to add a progress i e   pending certification done in the account   that would be very nice for all the developers out there waiting for their app so become reality   at the moment there are only apis for reading and writing nfc tags   unfortunately this is only a very small part of the nfc capabilities   with an iso smartcard support you would be able to communicate with smartcards like being used in public transport or supporting payment via nfc credit cards   these capabilities are well supported by other platforms and i would like to see this support on wp too   have you ever decided not to download an app while browsing the store simply because it did not have any ratings or reviews   if so then this issue should concern you as a developer   the app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews in the country that you live in   so for example if an app is published in canada and the united states and only the users in canada leave a rating reviews then the users in the united states will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not to download the app   this also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying or not enjoying the app   so i am suggesting that microsoft implement a system to show a consumer all the ratings and reviews   i understand there may be some issues with language etc   and an easy way to implement is to do this asides from bing translating wonderful app name user reviews worldwide reviews in your market this way a user can toggle between the world and local reviews   ratings and reviews are an important part of an app store otherwise why would microsoft bother having them   ratings and reviews are an important part of a developers promotion arsenal after all who would you rather believe the seller s ads or user reviews of the app   not all of us are the instagrams of the world and depend on each and every ratings we can get   so if you think it is only fair that users see all the reviews in the app store then please support this request by voting for it   this also gives the more   the idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device   currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real time as and when it happens   this reduces the transparency as well as ability to verify transaction   this is one of the important feature required in windows phone dev report   remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen where you can see everything that happened until interacted with on the phone by simply pressing the lock button on this screen and the logo of the application of the communication provides a small preview of a soft black and white and also allow us to access it only touched his notice   this implied that background applications in some cas updated costatemete si presents many notifications have an application that only the logo appears and the number of requests for this application   we can get the contact s details first name last name image email id mobile number etc stored in the phone but not the group details like group name member count member name s   for a phone hear and function called main so i need the driver api and identify the data call recording for example get the phone number to call to display information based on the number of phone customers prepare for new sales transactions over the phone   a virtual android application that allows the end user to play and install android apps on a windows phone within the app   update the wpdev feedback app   i want to communicate with the sensors in my app when phone is in standby mode   blackberry has an android runtime that can be used to run android apk files and developers can port their android app to the bb os   i think windows phone should make that happen in conjunction with their supporting xamarin and potentially hire me as a developer to help   would like to change the view of the contact being displayed   in the current view i can hardly see the contact number or anything that i would like to focus   if there is a way to change the data template for the list and details of a contact that would be great   also i would like to add more extension points to the contact details that are currently captured   that i suppose is currently not possible   forex trading platform to windows mobile   currently there doesn t seem to be any possibility to disable the bounce effect when scrolling inside the webbrowser control which makes any apps based in html look and feel cheap   this happens when you try to scroll beyond the bounds of the control and there is the elastic effect which allows you to move the page beyond the border of the control   would it be possible to disable this   the

way i have found to delete them is to delete them on my desktop and then reset my phone to factory defaults   we need to be able to use third party bluetooth equipment   at least do file transfer and keyboards like everyone else   above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers   from an old suggestion which got declined phone off locked reminder comes up reminder is setup to open the owner app when tapped user taps over reminder then unlocks target app is not launched expected tapping over the reminder and then unlocking should take the user to the target app just as it works when the phone is unlocked and a reminder pops up   see http wpdev uservoice com forums app platform suggestions bug click on reminder will not open target app w i really hope microsoft can resolve this issue because it is clearly a bug and it definitely does not work as designed   i can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked but at least give me a possibility to unlock the screen   currently the only options i have is to close the reminder by tapping the snooze or ignore or the back button   if this is working as designed then i thing the navigationuri in the reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen   furthermore without any scientific proofs i assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time   i can understand that tapping on the reminder more   please don t kill

windows phone application publish submission process   currently you can add delete and replace file but cannot download xap file for easy re editing unzip modify zip after failed certification test or whatever other purpose   it is impossible to manage even a hanging indent because paragraph lacks margin and textindent properties   however hacking a hanging indent is not the real goal general support for bulleting   build support for bullets and numbering into the paragraph class with properties something like this numberstart int inherit from previous run numberstyle enum none bullet arabic letter roman numberflags enum flags uppercase dottedlevels numberlevel int make numberstyle default to none and all this is non breaking   provide an api to list all the installed applications in a wp device this functionality can be enable once the user enroll successfully through company app   as a musician i often get mp s attached in e mails when we re in the process of recording mixing and editing music   i can only play them from the e mail directly but it s not possible to save them to your phone memory   would be nice if that was possible   there is no serious tfs application on windows phone store   please give us api for tfs so we can connect to tfs server see all our projects and users manage tasks manage code versioning and etc   this is must have for a development tool   recently i read about new winphone features and one of the which had took my attention is the notification area   i think you need to make a different notification area   on the winpho video it works like android and ios   you pull from the top to down and the notification area appears   why don t you use the winpho style   for example to show the notification area you swipe from left to right   when a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to up to ignore it or press it to open the application related to the notification   this notification in my opinion will make winpho stills a different os from android and ios   i hope to contribute to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone   i hope you like it   thank you and best regards   when a notification appears you have options swipe it from the left to right and brings the notifications area or swipe the notification from bottom to more   facebook for winpho needs better integration with facebook   it would be extremely helpful if the emulator could use webcams as camera emulation   otherwise ar scenarios are hard to develop without a range of devices   it has become even more needed with the addition of wxga and the different scalings in wp   improve microsoft account login usability in app   choose to login automatically with your microsoft account saved into phone also win rt without insert login and password again   it s so boring that you need do that also for microsoft apps like photosynth and skype   i just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specifically like sms   tl dr creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem   it would be great to see this circumvented somehow   one possibility instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace   now that obviously has the result of bad apps being near the top a lot so you modify that with ratings   highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles   for example my app is currently fairly well reviewed stars   however it never gets good visibility because it isn t the best which is actually subject to a very wide variety of opinions   it seems to me that all good apps games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just isn t worth it   another option is to do this with the featured apps in the marketplace   instead of ten featured games per day which all users see it would be better for each user to see a random set of games each time the marketplace is viewed   in this way every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps   there are a lot of reasons why this might be difficult but i feel that with a little bit of thought this could be a very profitable idea both for developers and for microsoft   my two cents   highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less more   import alert tones   need an api to hide cprog exe and bring other application to front ground   please implement style triggers for windows phone xaml baml   sometimes they re much more useful than data binding for example when i need a staticresource as a property value   as an app seller i have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while   i want to be able to refund a purchase that a customer made both in app products and paid downloads   i need a way to remove files from my wp device which have been disliked   since apps aren t allowed to modify files on sd cards i wanted to write a desktop sync app that would examine the device for any files that have been disliked and then remove them   however this is impossible with all existing api s   if i have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user s contacts i should have a way to click on that user and show the user s details in the native experience   i am familiar with the suggestion to take the contact s details and re create them in your own ui which would be great if the api exposed all of the user s details like the anniversary which it does not   also having a showcontacttask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on twitter or facebook without having to implement those sdks especially since the apis do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles   also having a showcontacttask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on twitter or facebook without having to implement those sdks especially more   ocr sample app using project hawaii ocr api   a sample project for using hawaii ocr api would be very helpful for the developers also need help with how to use image pre processing techniques and supported image processing libraries on wp to improve ocr accuracy   i recently submitted an app but the process hung when i clicked submit   i went through the whole process again but received the message that the alias was already in use   thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else i changed the name slightly   this submission went through smoothly   i later found that the original submission had also been successful even though it had hung so that there were now two duplicate submissions in processing certification with slightly different aliases   i wanted to delete the extra one but but could not   i could only change it to manually publish and hope to delete it later   it would be much preferable to remove it from the certificatio nprocess   i could only more   currently we have access to external mass storage   please provide access to internal too   currently the only way to upload the user files to the iso storage is to use the cloud like services skydrive   it does not make a sense when the large multimedia files have to be transferred you first have to transfer them up to skydrive and then download to phone   it would be great if the part of the application iso store could be made visible in the windows file explorer when the phone is connected by the usb cable   currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is very limited   currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is more   i liked android and now bought htc s with a gb microsd to find out that app to sd is not supported   i know that the copyright for apps schouldn t been touched but what about the app to internal memory and the needed files to microsd to support phones with short internal memory   today s world where java is every where i don t know why wp does not support java based applications and why microsoft haven t provided any way to develop wp applications in java   please expose the id property for contacts and appointments   at the moment it is private and inaccessible via reflection because of trust levels which makes unique contact appointment identification impossible   any application that might want to back up contact appointments and thus would need to differentiate between entities via a unique identifier cannot exist   please take this into consideration and make the id public maybe with a new capability requirement   language problem   if a listbox has elements with different sizes and you call scrollintoview to the last item the scrollviewer doesn t scroll to correct position   you can reproduce it adding rectangles with px px and px of height and calling scrollintoview to the last item   now on windows phone when we have resolutions taking screenshots may take a lot of time   you have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on   we can scale wxga to wvga it still requires some work because they have the same ratio but we can t do this with p   emulators are even slower than the wp ones so the process is really long   consider also option where you have application in several languages   you have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on   it takes a lot of time   i would like to ask microsoft to give us a tool option in emulator with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app   it would save us a lot of time   you have to take screenshots in one language change it to another wait until emulator reloads and so on more   there is an very old bug that is still present in windows

complete implementation of background audio player or the built in one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio title album without pausing playback   as developing xna apps in windows phone development will not be supported anymore we sometimes need to have d models and work with them inside application without need to learn c direct x which will take alot of time and maybe valuable for game developers only   so we need aupport for such feature in xaml code like in silverlight   i want to create a app for incoming call recording but wp not provide any api for do this   also need api for voice record with background agent   provide api to easy save settings of an app online and restore after unnstall or reset change phone using a microsoft

wp the default pivot control now correctly displays the title text at the top of the page with the phonefontfamilysemibold and phonefontsizemedium styles but the standard blank page template still uses phonetextnormalstyle which uses the normal font weight and a slightly smaller size for the page title   these page templates should be updated to use the medium sized semibold font by default for the title text   this change would encourage consistency with both the apps built in to the os and within an app itself   this should also be fixed in the wp sdk where all page templates including the pivot template still use phonetextnormal style for the title   this should also be fixed in the wp sdk where all page templates including the pivot more   haciendo que el celular del lumia se pueda utilizar como almacenamiento masivo como cualquier otro celular   currently microsoft phone info devicestatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from c# project making it a round way about to include this project in c managed code   it would be helpful if we have an equivalent api available in c   if you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working   it fires the navigating event but not the navigated event   seems that it is waiting to receive credential but no popup is showed   after this the control is no more usable the only option is to close the application and reload all   allow a user to change the ring tone or sound of new txt messages coming to the phone   after the to update i was so thankful that the arrow icon the arrow that takes you to the apps page even though you can just swipe the page   was taken off to leave more room for the icons on the homescreen   however there is still a mm gap at the top of the page not including the space for the time etc that is wasteful   can you get rid of this space to enable more icons to fit to the homescreen   it s so annoying   add a boolean to the cameracapturetask to optionally add the picture taken to the camera roll   an app for online clothes shopping so that we are able to buy clothes from our phones should be made   the webclient type doesn t allow me to use cookies stored by the web browser control and i ll have to ask the user for credentials which they ve already stored in the form of cookies through the login page of a particular site in the web browser   there is an indirect way of using browserhttp but it s kinda buggy   it s not exposed by the sdk please fix it   we need a way to save videos to the camera roll   the leak of a medialibrary savevideo method makes third party video apps very uncomfortable for the user   it will be gode to can add custom sound to toas notifications   if we can see the current voltage level we can determine if the phone is plugged in to usb power or utilizing an induction charger   certain wp phones have wireless or inductive charging and we need to be able to calculate the efficiency of these chargers   a thick phone case or simply not centering the phone on the charging plate can result in reduced charging capacity and much longer charging times   adding visbility to the battery mah would then allow battery health apps charger comparisons and inductive charger efficiency or inneficiency   for example allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on usb vs induction   please add the capability to view voltage and mah or if possible another method to check if the device is charging with usb power or wireless power   for example allowing the user to view the time more   we need different sound levels sound level for system for alarm clock for music radio and different for keyboard   i want to have sounds enabled to

point   option to browse in private   reminder api only allows the developer to repeat at least once in a day   it would be nice to schedule a reminder to repeat at x hours   currently it is impossible to pause in in progress backgroundtransferrequest   this would be beneficial for apps where multiple downloads may be running at once and the user wants to optimise the order in which they download   the majority of apps i see at the marketplace doesn t have any review s   i think that has an overall negative effect user wise community wise and dev wise maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it   i know that thinking up such a system isn t easy as you would have to think carefully about abuses   there is currently no indication that an application is being featured it would be nice to receive a email prior to it being featured to indicate what dates countries it will be featured in   so we can see all our emails in single app   i think that there should be a nice feature were you can be able to slide the status bar down and view all the push notifications that you got but you didn t view just like android and ios but the best part is that it fixes many problems like when people wanted a short cut to turn wifi on and off and data on and off so that would be a nice feature to have   i strongly think that more background color s should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff like that and more accent colors   keep tiles   make it so the xbox app has smart glass in it without having to install the app directly but put the games in a different folder   better music player i like the zune on interface or xbox music interface but i would like it so you can do more customization with it and have it so we can move a scroller on the bar that tells you how many minutes have you been playing the song so that we can skip through the music to our favorite part   better people app i like the people app with the ui and the facebook twitter linkedin integration but the thing i would like most is if you made the top thing that said people was a smaller text it take to much space on the app   make it so the tiles can be see through and the background can be a background image that would look nice   better marketplace i would like a new ui   keyboard is nice but when you do landscape mode on the keyboard the whole screen is not covered by the keyboard the status bar sort of shortens the keyboard so it would be nice if the status bar didn t interfere   mobile teethering i would appreciate this to be on a new wp update for wp and wp but would be fine   i strongly think that more background color s should be there like instead of just black and white have blue red green and stuff more   in our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx   every sec only when subscribed to geolocator s statuschanged positionchanged works fine otherwise   does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources   is there any way to select a location source s to use like on other platforms   some especially for mobile useful css features like ms scroll chaining snap points and several others are missing from the phone version of ie which cripples the touch experience and requires additional and less smooth js libraries   it s especially frustrating while developing native html based apps   please make an option like windows phone to mark several messages at the time of deletion as tapping and holding of every message and deleting take more time and it makes angry   please make an option to mark messages for windows phone   allow the use of desktop keyboard to interact with wp emulator similar to the current mouse functionality   wish there was a way for mails contacts calendars etc to be pulled from an owa url into the email account definitions   bb has this as a standard feature out of the box while rd party apps are available under ios though not half as good as the bb   this is particularly helpful when activesync has not been enabled   if the information is available from a browser it should be available to an app   i want to be nice about this one but seriously   why is it impossible to get the contact designated by the system as me for the purposes of getting my current picture   why should i have to implement a contactpicker to make the user choose or implement the live sdk and force them to log in when the phone already knows   i understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the mailboxes in the phone but there should be an api to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics like the number of unread emails number of important emails and the total e mail count   there are more and more external sensors not only medical but all kind of proximity stuff for watches smart apliances cars and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door to thousands of new apps   as usual microsoft is late in this too and so we have to focus development on ios and android that have the sdk up to date with technology   app will not upload photos   only video   we use microsoft expression encoder to do live smooth streaming video feeds   i was surprised to find that the built in media player doesn t support the html video element and live streaming   video src http mlmidev webcastcenter com mlm idev isml manifest format m u aapl m u video it works on ios android and apple computers with safari   since this is a microsoft technology or at least i thought it was i figured it would work wonderfully on window phone   i can use a silverlight player program bitgravity player is what i m currently using but it requires me to type an address in   it s just one area that i can t recommend windows phones to people   i used to be able to recommend windows mobile phones because we used windows media streaming server and it had windows media player   it s just one area that i can t recommend more   you can retweet and answer tweets but you cant favorite   the restrictions on the calendar edit delete are rediculous   let the user decide if an app should have access to calendar files   this rigid rule makes it impossible to make a functional rd party calendar app   look at how much week calendar from utilitap have improved ios for several years before they made a better icalendar app   i had decided to buy a wp phone but aslong as the calendar lacks so many functions and there is no hope of a better rd party app i will stick with ios or possibly android   this is the most important feature lacking in wp   by far   this is the most important feature lacking in more   let battery more efficient and alarm can work if the phone turned off   that last update at the end of jan made the touch responsiveness on my nokia much worse   the phone jumps to other pages when i am scrolling up and down   wish i can undo that patch   this would open the way for developers to create applications that will allow users to add unique colors to customize their device   this is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog but being able as a developer   to add more colors to that list from your app   windows phone includes a new map control   it has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names   street names over the route will be shown in another color and are moved to stay always in center   to add a route to the map you have to create maproute object that accepts only route object in it s constructor   but route object does not have public constructor   the only possibility to create route is routequery class   this is a problem   routequery uses online service to calculate the route   apps can t show the traveled route at real time on the map like jogging apps   because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently   it is possible to workaround this with mappolyline   but the polyline is shown over the street names   street names color stays black and not being centered   also if the new map has route feature it should be usable   possible solution route class implements iroutepath   maproute constructor should accept iroutepath inteface instead of route class   apps can t show the traveled route at more   the contact class is missing at least one data point the anniversary   please make sure that any data accessible from the contact details page is made available to the contact class   other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full   now uninstalling apps also is not of much use a reset needs to be done   when skype replaces messenger don t forget wp users background push messaging   improve its data base and functionality   market it more as a visual assistant   ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see   scan it and bing vision give u a list of the nearest theatres and show times or post a reminder in your calendar   you see a ad for a pair a shoe you want   scan it and bing vision give you a list of the nearest store that have them in stock   as the current time sync does not work correctly at least in the netherlands i want the option to build my own   allow zune music video tile in windows phone to fetch metadata and display artist images and artist names in india too settings applications lock wallpaper show artist image when playing music under lock screen   this option is also not work until we have metadata of song i e   artist image   please make it available as it also makes the zune tile live   the windows rt simulator lets you emulate multitouch interaction by exploiting the use of the mouse wheel   it would be very helpful the same functionality also in the windows phone emulator   add an option for remove the image in a contact   big lack   you can add an image but you cant remove it   allow close the task on long press right button in phone   sometimes phone is getting stucked while unlocking phone on my htc s   windows phone may have new resolutions but it only actually has two aspect ratios scaling and scaling accessible through app current host content scalefactor   because wvga and wxga are the same aspect ratio and because the website is a giant pita in uploading images you have to take and submit screenshots per actual screenshot per language   screenshots in two languages turns into screenshots which is totally nuts   if you guys employed a net module like imageresizing net on your hosting clusters you could reduce it to screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting wxga and p images and then autoscaling the wxga images down to wvga through an image handler   that would significantly reduce the amount of effort a developer has to go through to publish an app   if you guys employed a net module like imageresizing net on your hosting clusters you could reduce it to screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting wxga and more   add support for office to directly send presentation to wireless projector   i have a valid phone

and a space by hitting space twice like this   but look what happens when i try note the lower case i to use the auto complete which is set to add a space after being used it won t subsequently recognise the double space like so this should be new sentence but instead i have three spaces   but look what happens when i try note the lower case i to use the auto complete which is set to add a

while it appears under its new name in marketplace i can t change it to the new name in app hub   as a recent purchaser of a windows phone i love the platform and it has huge potential to grow in competition with android and apple   i am concerned however that microsoft are not pushing enough for access to successful top selling apps which are popular on the iphone and android platforms e g   instagram   if windows phones are to compete they have to acknowledge the big selling apps or they risk losing market share rather than gaining it   i m developing an app containing data that a user might want to keep in view for a while without worrying about accidentally pressing any of the hardware buttons thereby exiting the current view   it would be great if i could display an option to lock the screen which would basically lock the screen but show my own page as the lock screen   maybe the normal screen timeout would apply here as well rather than the lock screen timeout   if the screen turned off pressing the unlock button would again display my page maybe with a built in label at the bottom instructing the user to slide to unlock   if the screen turned off pressing the unlock button would again display my page maybe with a built in label at the bottom more   on the windows phone website my account shows all the apps i downloaded but after resetting my phone i was

and i m sad to see it go with the zune hd and not move over to windows phone   when we are on call and the same time i want to look up for a number from phone book i can t do it right now   i ll have ro out the other caller on hold to get a number   adding this feature will help alot   at the moment there s no way for an app to know if its primary live tile is visible or not   although the native screenshot feature is reported to not be available until windows phone i have some concerns regarding this feature that may impact windows phone apps as well   since this issue will impact my decisions when developing my windows phone app i do not consider this off topic   i am concerned whether we will be able to opt out or disable the feature within our apps   i am concerned about security and drm issues   will microsoft provide an api that will allow us to   programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app   if so what happens to existing windows phone apps that run on a windows phone device   will screen shots work by default for windows phone apps   if so and there is no api to restrict usage for existing windows phone app but there will be an api to restrict functionality for windows phone app i may want to wait for windows phone before deploying my app   programmatically enable or disable the feature more   so that we can trigger our application on such events   at the moment developers do not have any control on such tasks   and its very frustrating to see other platforms like android and blackberry developers can easily do it   so that i can manage the phone send messages manage apps account settings and so on   all this by using the bigger and faster interface of the computer   i do really like the idea of contract in

that we can have multiple tiles sure it s great that they can open the app   but why not let us flip the tile instead note the mail tile would always open the app   think of a stocks app where you see

are mandatory rating agency requirements   in the start screen   the current developer ecosystem for windowsphone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the marketplace   internal use of apps is defined as a beta test and requires a list of live ids designated to allow a certain set of users to download and use the app   this is very limited and also time consuming   ideally a company may wish to dedicate a group of live ids as testers to be used each time   for this cost a company would receive two unlocked windowsphone devices that could be traded or upgraded   this allows a team to use these devices for testing as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations   the enterprise account would also allow for distribution of apps at the organizational level either in house or to clients   the targeted distribution approach doesn t seem to satisfy the need to sell or distribute from a company to clients   it could also allow for a specific download key if purchases were made outside of the app marketplace   together this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or

apps will be essentially undiscoverable no matter how good they are start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word such as childrens stories so that new apps who innovate can

requirements that involve phone calls text messages and zune hub music are all impossible to test from within the emulator   in trying to develop a custom playlist application it is apparent that it is impossible to integrate the backgroudaudioplayer with the xna medialibrary   this means that applications that wish to use the capabilities of the backgroundagent are restricted to using only local audio files that are deployed with teh application or audio streaming sources   there is no way to access the phone s medialibray songs to have the bap play these files in teh background   this is highly restrictive because we can only use the mediaplayer for foreground applications   unless of course we go with a predetermined songcollection such as songcollection limitedplaylist new medialibrary songs this stops the ability to create custom playlists   there are really a number of ways ms could address this limitation   this way we can pass the entire songcollection object to the mediaplayer play method and providing we don t stop the mediaplayer the entire playlist will continue to play despite other foreground applications running   so long as the user must explicitally accept the use of teh app in the background then why is it an issue   users understand the additional strain this would potentially put on battery life but by accepting they agree that it s okay   these are only my suggestions there may be smarter ways to achieve this but in the end the current functionallity is pointless   wifi wifi   condensed pivot segoe x height   i can see two ways of

 the event arguments from the addresschoosertask only returns the contact address as a string   so if we need a specific part of the address we d have to do some fairly tricky parsing   it would be

applications to turn the speaker on while headset is connected   especially for fm radio and other audio jack connected applications   security for the user is reduced by each app having to store credentials to online services e g   facebook other third party services   i would suggest a common credential store such as accounts where users would need to be prompted so the application could

an emulator have it s code add wav headers to the audio stream and save it to an isolated storage   then copy it to a windows environment to play in media player   at the beggining of an audio a bump is heard   the problem may be relevant to htc hd only though since i have no other device to test   in order to reproduce it one should just try to record an audio on the more   even if mediaplayer

be happy   and ms will beat all the other plat forms   would be nice to mirror phone screen to tv through xbox like ios ipad apple tv   i noticed that on some windows phones the touch sensitive buttons vibrate and some don t   and the focus s and flash you can change it   i have a dell venue pro and the buttons don t vibrate   all windows phones with touch sensitive buttons should vibrate   when returning to an app using multitasking   the ability to create multiple custom start views for pinning tiles to similar to android and ios   for example one screen for work one for personal and

other platforms are having the option for usb debugging   the same could be implemented in the windows phone so that developer can use it hassle free   a general use case is that i m working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now i stopped debugging and now i started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the

experiences are currently blocked   instead an app developer must re implement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the pc zune software   once access

simply achieved as a new podcast genre however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a user s genres are musical other than the

launchers should have a callback that returns a string error message   if the launcher isn t possible a property would be useful for disabling enabling buttons that start the launchers   would like to see an improvement in mappolyline that allows multiple individual segments that have there own properties i e   for example once you add a location to mappolyline instance that becomes a segment i should then be able to control the look and feed such as color of the stroke for that segment of the mappolyline   currently changing the stroke changes the color for the entire line regardless of how many locations are added to the line   also would like the ability to make the line a d gradient shape to have it pop out more on the map control   i wish i could select connection speed for debugging in the emulator   the android emulator can it   there s one area where mango is a retrograde step when compared with nodo theme support   in nodo the user could leave the app switch the theme i e   dark or light return to the app which would now in theory respect their selection   in mango the user s faced with an unholy mess because the app is only informed of the system s theme state at start up   developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme sticking to it thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless   the smscomposetask does not provide any events   i think we need completed event and something like smsresult that can be used   currently some tasks exhibit this behaviour and some do not   please make it a standard mode of

book applications and do nothing apps i e   the stuff published by eric rulz   this is just absolutely ridiculous   you already promised to take care of this but it didn t work   we ve still useless applications flooding the marketplace and there are no signs of it slowing   i believe that instead of limiting the amount of certifications per user per day the marketplace should be a little better curated   spam applications should not be approved   they should never pass certification and should never be published   bulk publishers should be made to consolidate their apps and the rest should not pass   they should more   i thought i had raised this as a platform request but seems it s showing up in feature feedback instead   multiline text input in the current version of the platform is usable if you can work out how or be told how to do it however it s not very intuitive and i m concerned for apps that have this as a substantial feature the experience for consumers is not what it could be   current capability for multiline navigation via textbox the way it currently works is if you tap and hold you get the i cursor to appear   if you entered long lines of text that take up the width of the textbox then you will likely instinctively find you can scroll up and down through the text by dragging the cursor above and below the textbox   however if you entered shorter lines you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the i cursor makes contact with some text   you will see it visually lock in to the text when this happens   i believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers to make use of apps that depend on multiline input that potentially is longer than displayed in half allowing for the sip a portrait or landscape screen   what would improve usability   swipe gesture to control vertical scrolling when vertical scrollbar is auto visible latter is currently ignored   if using tap hold allow vertical scrolling without locking into text as described above   alternatively to provide an experience consistent with the platforms sms text input capability provide support to allow textbox to grow as new

would like to write business applications that get started when the phone is turned on and have as much control as a running app an idea would be having the phone snap pictures periodically and then uploading them   there is currently no way to know if an emailcomposetask was cancelled or got an error while sending   i need to be able to tell if the user actually went through with the email to know whether to delete the email text   otherwise i have to ask the user if they sent it poor user experience   for those of us wanting to provide free applications it would be nice if the wp supported self signed certs or the very least a widely known free ssl authority   add servicepointmanager   or at the very least add a free service to your accepted list of ssl authorities   like cacert org for instance   i would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time   it should be able to recur but to save battery it could be limited to daily   think of an app that needs to update the tile once a year or month to remind the user of something   currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after days if the application is not opened   app specific launchers instead of opening a site s web page check whether a compatible app is installed or registered   ux is much better and   to support things like midroll video advertisments multiple mediaelements are needed   this is supported in silverlight for the web   it would be helpfull to have a passwordbox like control which supports number only keyboard   numeric only passwords makes more sense for smartphone world as its fast convenient and easy to type   private corporate wifi authentication with a certificate is not supported at mango   this could allow for quite a few scenarios someone is currently locked in with a carrier that doesn t have wp phones available   they could actually purchase apps on the marketplace and use them   enable a code once and runs on windows or phone   it would be good to have a video chooser task that works in the same way as the photochoosertask   the reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters add audio tracks crop out a relevant section etc of a recorded video and saving it back to the medialibrary   i assume saving to the medialibrary will be part of the ar functionality in mango anyway   this will benefit for applications which create audio or recording voice it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program   cursor arrow keys are needed on the virtual keyboard   using touch to position the cursor is a good start but it s clumsy and easily off by one character which would be acceptable if there were at least a left arrow key in addition to backspace   perhaps at least press hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu   besides myself is there any interest in adding this capability   i request that the multiscaleimage library to be able to access isolated storage   there are many places where apps will not connect to a cell tower e g   in a general aviation or commercial aircraft where cell phones do not work well it is illegal to use in any case and also in isolated rural areas   also why pay data charges to view the same image over and over aren t music photo libraries stored on phones   and finally memory is very cheap   some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that is ridiculous   if a user wants an application to host content whether it be gb of music or gb of image tiles for a needed application that should be their prerogative   local multiscaleimage functionality is available on iphone so please do not put wp developers at a disadvantage   if a user wants to pan around a large image what difference does it make to the form factor whether it is local or online none   please get this component opened up for isolated storage use in the near future   some suggest that large images even broken into tiles are inappropriate for storage on a phone that more   the implementation of the sql compact was a pretty steap learning curve for me as i was used to the net gui implementation that made it very easy to use   i think there needs to be more focus on making it easier and quicker to implement these plumbing features as a lot of developers will be hobbyist and do not contain the time and knowledge required to implement of lot of these plumbing features   please make it quick and simple for us to get our ideas out there   detailed customization should be an after thought for us   allow apps with the interop capabilty flag in the manifest perhaps via custom certificate like microsoft office digital certificate for vba projects   these are valid only on the device on which they were created so the only phone you d brick would be your dev unlocked own   ok i realize that this is dependent on the carrier but wp needs to support it if the carrier can offer it   somebody correct me if i m way off base   please let me know how to do this   both on my ios and droid i can use my work email exchange server   however the webbased certificate is not signed by a trusted member and was always allowed to okay it with those oses   wp will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if i know it is okay   ability to display street side and birds eye view from bing map control   when you update an app and update the app tile icon and or

gui displayed for context sensitive search   the hardware button seems to always pull up a bing   surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive   if so then the soft search button is not needed and can be removed from being displayed if a hardware button is available   this would free up more screen real estate especially as many application bars only have a soft search button on them anyway   in order to display more details on network connection and to distinguish wifi networks connected to   allow filtering of marketplace results within categories beyond pay free top new by adding filter by rating ex by price ex by number of downloads ex or allow blacklisting of developers or developer rankings so spam apps and spam devs could be avoided   enable fm scan function in the developer api   i notice it is already available to the user in the version mango but i don t see methods in the api for scanning to the next signal or seeking whatever the term is called   allow apps to be hidden visible in the store without having to go through the whole update process   back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden   handy for if you have to take the back end server offline so new users can t download your app and instantly think the app is useless   in the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store or if exist it is really well hidden   in addiction if you try delete an app name you can also confirm your operation but the name doesn t get deleted and stay reserved for the app   i can t see the total downloads of my apps anymore because the downloads prior to the new dashboard has vanished   currently we need to do some trickery to take screenshots of application that use panorama control   we can access exif info limited using a picture object when dealing with media library   but if we try to save an image within app inside media

apps it was not and nobody ever got why   copy from android and add beta and alpha store too   do not complain if developers prefer other platforms you don t make us life easy at all   currently you can assign to applicationbariconbutton an icon present on your project as content   this basically means you have to determine your icons at design time   by providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the isolatedstorage the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime dynamically download them from other places etc   there is no such option to delete the beta app from

that is not supported for example   more then one developer may have worked on the app and are now splitting   some people may sell their apps to others   in all these cases it breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have to create a new app instead of updating the existing one   when i create a paid app with a trial option many users blow right by it because it doesn t show up in the free category even though a light version of the app is free via the trial   some people are resorting to the super inefficient apple app store method of releasing versions of the app one that shows up in the free category and another that runs as a paid app   the trial is a fantastic concept but it is hobbled by this oversight   add ado net to the silverlight net framework so you can use datasets when working with xml and relational data via c# in windows phone   right now there is no way to sync anything but pictures generated on the phone to the user s pc   if i create a

uploading games in windows phone store but from last friday there seems to be some kind of bug in your windows phone store   i have created one new app and reserved it s name on that called

another new game in the store itself   i am using visuall studio   updating an app listing that supports multiple languages is one of the most painful experiences when developing for windows   why can we not just have a store manifest that includes all localized descriptions screenshots etc   which will be detected when we upload the app via the dashboard   it would allow us to skip all that crazy input in different languages just to for example swap out one screenshot   alternatively provide an api for the submission process so we can at least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves   it would be a great way to better integrate applications if there was a sports news hub   i imagine the default setup could simply default to news and sports from msn or one of ms other affiliates then allow rss feeds to be added   enhance that further by allowing rd party application tie ins like espn s app or news from a bbc or cnn application   ms could even add features like they have in media center for sports such as a ticker feed and fantasy player tracking   support windows server r   controls displaying the sip when focused should provide a method to close the sip to ensure data binding is

windowsmobile status on the development of your windows phone   purpose events related to when one phone call starts and ends   also something for sms   this is for perform any action on background   allow developers to use an in built api to compress videos captured from the camera using either h or mpeg   sometimes it s usefull to explore and tranfer back files generated in app that s running on phone emulator back to the developer pc without additional coding   remove the recipient cap on app generated sms messages   obviously this is in place to ensure people do not spend lots of money if they don t have unlimited bundles   however a simple message box saying this message is going to be sent to people are you sure you want to send would be sufficient   this system for featuresuggestion is good but i miss the feedback to the feedback   at the moment only one idea is marked as planed   even some of the ideas will ship in the next update they haven t marked as planed or startet   which would give the people that use this platform give a positive feedback and get there votes back without manualy search for votes they no longer need because it will be provided in the next update   the

developed in andriod   please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a git repository and simply push to a git remote to upload   currently it is very tedious and takes hours to submit an app update especially when you have multiple app packages and lots of languages   you have to manually use the website to change descriptions switch languages lots of copy and paste remove each screenshot put a new screenshot   it literally takes hours and it drives you crazy   instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly   currently apps are executed in sandboxes and there s no way to apps can work together   one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes   the same is true for applications and the os itself   some kind of handlers on context menus of certain objects would be great   the context menu of images could list tasks provided by apps dealing with images   in more detailed extremely simplified what about having an app that rotates an image an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer   in

nonexistence of visual voice mail is stopping a switch from the iphone   is there a way to access voice mail metadata   distribute more application bar icons in sdk at least each one used by built in applications provide forum marketplace for other artwork including control templates styles   increase webbrowser control function   google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading of ebooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading of ebooks but none of theme have inbuilt dictionary and they lack in many features in terms of user experience   it will be nice if window phone or all microsoft devices have onebooks application for reading ebooks and magazines etc   i understand the max size limitation to control   and there are some approach to work around on most of the controls   however for some control e g   textbox it s a big problem   socket apis and duplex wcf communication   currently it s not possoble to make connections behind proxy

support chinese   allow developers to alter edit an applications metadata including description images graphics pricing and keywords etc once the app is published without resubmitting   this would make bug fixes to spelling and screeshots simple would save microsoft from having to test submissions for metadata only   maybe sending a zip   system supported application error reporting service that would report back to developers application crashes and details   i wish i could simulate multitouch on the emulator ie pinch and zoom with mice   just like the picture extras it d be great if apps like twitter and facebook could register to be on the list of applications that a user can share a piece of text with in addition to email and sms   this enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info   this enables caching of and usage of offline maps   until windows phone this part was too painful and took a lot of time and work   hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots   then i navigate to another page press the button and it take n screenshots again one for each language   in the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once   provide a pre certification tool that runs all the tests the marketplace certification tool runs   so developpers can have more confidence it will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting to the marketplace   time saver for developers and microsoft   the phone currently plays a large selection of media formats mp m v gp etc that aren t supported in the emulator   this makes apps that use these formats extremely hard to debug   would be awesome if you could fix this   just like the picture music extras to be able to integrate in a persons phone numbers unkown caller so to add phone services to easy search for numbers or to be able to start a contact message app from the

sometimes i feel it s so high and i want to edit it but no way to do this   currently only store apps can be submitted to the store   please allow me to submit existing windows desktop software to the store   with all the new screen sizes and resolutions testing in the emulator is certainly one way to try them out but it d aid in even more rapid development to be able to see them on the design surface like we already have for wvga wxga and p sizes   we re still missing the p and sizes   currently if we logged in twitter fb or any other social networking sites throug their apis we cant logout   it is because the web browser keeps the cookies   so he cant login into his another account   currently windows phone if you store your credentials in the passwordvault they aren t deleted on app uninstall so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available   i think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall   creating a modern windows app can require creating a lot of project files one one per platform type windows phone windows phone windows and windows with each project generating its own unique output   even universal app projects create multiple projects one for windows another for windows phone neither of which support the previous versions of windows to note   on ios it s possible to target many versions of the os etc   with a

comes out it s possible to upgrade the app s project and still have it s output support older versions of the os   windows projects when updated to windows projects lose their ability to support windows   being able to target multiple versions of windows with a single project one that preferably built a single app package would be useful   furthermore upgrading that project to target the

chance in any country there are no reviews on your app and someone want to download your app he might not just because he can t find it first of all cuz no rating second he she will think app doesn t

submit app packages as a user with the developer role https msdn microsoft com library windows apps mt aspx however it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app

the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates even if the app is not the official one   the main problem is that the new users don t know about third party clients

if you use a rd party control library or you re a control library vendor you should vote for this   it ll save you a lot of typing looking for controls and types etc   xmlnsdefinitionattribute is an absolutely great attribute for control library developers   it allows the developers of that control library to greatly simplify the xaml by reducing the number of xmlns declarations they need   the only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in xaml not just controls but other types too in the same namespace creating a very ugly unwieldy api to code against   it ll save you a lot of typing looking more   with the advent of build the vision and direction of microsoft seems to be open source and cross platform   please provide consistency throughout the entire microsoft development ecosystem   currently you have to provide a splash screen to get your app to pass the certification kit which should really be a developer s choice like

loaded from a source local file or remote from the web there are few current tools for converting svg to wpf silverlight based xaml but they fall short when dealing with more complex svg data this should work just like any other kind of image data   some svg files may be dynamically generated by a remote server svg data loaded in a xaml view may have internal named elements   i would imagine that there d be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers hover touch etc change properties color opacity etc   we used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in xaml there s a lot of free source svg files that usable under creative commons on wikipedia for things like us maps electoral districts and many other rich features   o it s a huge time saver to piggyback on those assets   for example suppose you wanted to color a us map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way   this is easily done with some reference data svg from wikipedia   problem is there s no way to easily manipulate this within a xaml app i would hope that an svg renderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the html renderers use i would not expect to use javascript css classes to manipulate svg from a xaml app but bonus points if xaml styles could be plugged in manual conversion to xaml is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets   a designer may keep tweaking the source image and must keep generating that xaml   that xaml would then need to be copied into a resource dictionary and can t be a separate file resource can it   the high level ask is to support using svg within a xaml tree   the svg data may be inline or loaded from a source local file or remote from the web there are few current tools for converting svg to wpf silverlight based xaml but they fall short when dealing with more complex svg data   here are a few scenarios apps loading svg content from a remote web server   this should work just like any other kind of image data   remote xaml isn t likely allowed and even if it were there d be resistance to providing vector art in two formats when svg more   there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio   without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator   the older tooling appdeploycmd exe would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them though it s support for devices left a lot to be desired   oddly with windows tooling installed and windows sdk we can actually see the list of windows emulators listed in the appdeploycmd output and need to do some post filtering to separate the and emulators   so currently we can use the tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them they ll start up but app deployment will fail   in doing some testing it appears winappdeploycmd may work to install an appx on a running emulator if we happen to know the   x x ip address of the emulator but i can find no way to get that

for the store search can be summarised as follows as a windows app consumer i want to be able to search for apps by name so that i can find and download the specific app i am looking for   as a windows app consumer i want to be able to search for apps by functionality so that i can find and download an app that will help me perform the task i want to carry out   an example of the first might be i ve heard that wordament is good so i ll type wordament into the search box so i can download and play it during my commute to work   an example of the second might be i really enjoy doing crossword puzzles so i ll type crosswords into the search box so that i can find and download a crossword app that i play during my commute to work   the store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords   it would seem that the search algorithm has been developed to optimise results for use case one above at the expense of use case two   in my view and i can see from the forums and user voice channel that i am not alone in this the store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two   it is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one   intuitively if a user already knows the name of an app then it is likely that it is already fairly popular and so would be ranked highly in search results without the algorithm favouring the app name   in addition app names are quite specific and so searches for facebook and wordament should return a narrow set of results compared to searches for generic terms such as crosswords   conversely new apps that are not yet popular would be unknown to consumers and so would only be found when a user browses categories in the store or searches for apps by functionality as in use case two   more info https social msdn microsoft com forums windowsapps en us ce d a ec f f d

support recommended me to post the issue here there seems to be a long standing serious issue with the store or possibly the dev portal which needs to be addressed urgently   these users are now

them to contacting microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re purchase the app   the issue gets complicated when the users owned the app via a free promo and

winform projects and could speed up development on universal app too   there are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete remove apps and iaps from their dev center   so i think you should add some hide some option to not only unpublish app but eventually logically remove their entries from the dashboard main app list graphs etc you can eventually add a page where all the apps iaps hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them to the dashboard in case he changes his mind   do you think it can work this way   there are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete remove apps and iaps from their dev center   these feedbacks were all refused and i can imagine the motivation behind this so i try to formulate better what s really the point is on this if a developer has many unpublished apps or iaps their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not more relevant data regarding to app that there aren t no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now   so i think you should more   it is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is nt show in any category and

had it s own serialization deserialization mechanism in xamlservices class furthermore this xaml system had a very powerful component concept that is conspicuously absent in winrt markup extensions   markup extensions are found in the following xaml systems wpf silverlight xamarin forms notably not a microsoft technology but recognizes their power nonetheless this feature is to ask for xaml

updating   anyone lese facing the same   please vote   filtering out the windows by category shown almost no results   these lists are are broken so there is no actual way to find games you are looking for by category as most are only showing a handful of games per category   there are some devs that are making multiple windows store accounts to spam the same repackaged apps   this is unfair to devs and cheapens the windows store experience   for instance the following dev accounts have the same apps spammed under multiple accounts maajio dev box team dopeware labs yemba dev wamba dev all of the above accounts are the same developer   the apps all go to the same facebook page   i have reported this and nothing has been done about it   should i just assume that spamming multiple apps is ok and do the same in order to compete   why can t microsoft shut down all the extraneous accounts   why more   my idea to add a feature of apps to be given permission by the user to run in background whenever required prompting the user that enabling an app to run in background may cause battery drainage   in dev center i can see the downloads for only up to apps at once   please allow seeing download numbers for all apps in the chart for any given time period   unfortunately neither the smartcard class nor the smartcardprovisioning class nor any other related class provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later   a getter for this value should be added   within windows phone it was possible to use the microsoft xna framework media mediaplayer to get information song album artist name about the currently playing songs   pleas bring back the capability to read this information   it appears there is a enter file name even when selecting an existing file using filesavepicker on uwp mobile   it would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the dom that is in the currently loaded page of the webview control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary   winjs could be modernized streamlined and simplified as part of the open source project by providing only that functionality not now supported by es   edge browser vs and vs code already provides support for es   for older browser that do not fully support es the code could be transpiled into es by babeljs traceur etc   add api to full control of glance screen   right now we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done by using requestmessage transportinformation   it is possible to install allowed certificates through the package appxmanifest file and then checking exclusive trust   but unfortunately this is application wide and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included

via chat they give me illogical answer like your app its not on market and its not searchable but only deeplink work   i think maybe on purpose from the windows store market worker did nt want electronics center app on top on united states shopping category   i want see electronics center app on market again here is electronics center app link https www microsoft com store apps wzdncrdq qp it was top popular on united states shopping category instantly disappear from the market its not searchable its gone   i ask via chat they give me illogical answer like your app its not on market and its not searchable but only deeplink work   how the quality and useful app can be disappear gone without any notification   i want see electronics center app on market more   there is currently no way how to display in webview https web page with invalid certificate even with user specific opt in   the clipboard content for example a file copied in the clipbord get lost if the the app is closed but it should be persistent   update image control to support animated gifs   i would like to be able to set the source of an image control to an animated gif and have it start playing in a loop   i don t like comparisons however all the windows uwp effort is another attempt to get users into the windows platform right well you re still missing the point   android has an excellent tutorial for learning the basics and creating an app even if you re not a java expert   starting a project for a uwp is really hard   you have to be an expert to bootstrap a project   there are no templates in vs like they are in android studio   there is a github repository but the samples have errors and it is difficult to modify them to suit your needs   the quickstart video on mva is excellent but where is the code   i personally believe windows is an excellent platform just go the extra mile polish the workflow and make it easier for us developers non experts to start a project   i don t like comparisons however all the windows uwp effort is another attempt to get users into the windows platform right   well you re still missing the point   there is a github repository but the samples have errors and it is difficult to modify them to suit your more   my lumia micro usb port just broke so i need to deploy via wifi or bluethoot   currently the windows phone and windows store merge as one the windows dev center app also need to update   remove max limitation on zoomlevel   it would be nice to be able stretch bing maps data a bit more and for custom detailed tilelayers it would be also great   it should be possible to deploy a uwp app inside the edge browser as opposed to the app store   firstly deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc from microsoft when the app users won t even be the general public   this burns microsoft time as well as developer time   secondly we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers   this is going to be a nightmare to maintain in the app store   in silverlight it s maintained merely with different urls   thirdly in store apps are going to create all kinds of nightmares for us in dealing with it departments that want to lock down app store usage   it should be possible to deploy a uwp app inside the edge browser as opposed to the app store   in browser apps will need to be sand boxed without elevated trust permissions in browser deployment was an excellent feature of silverlight   while most organizations will allow in store apps it s still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons   secondly we have many versions more   bring back sql server compact in windows uwp   i ve developed application which targets windows phone   read email access locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for uwp apps   i developed the app bizview a google analytics client with the same features of official google analytics app in the android store   the previous app are old not updated with less reviews low rating how bizview can not be first in all regions   this question is not because bizview is my own app the question is for all developers that works hard   best regards stefano montimoregi i developed the app bizview a google analytics client with the same features of official google analytics app in the android store   bizview rating is about and has many reviews   bizview is updated usually adding features   the problem is if i search google analytics in windows mobile store the app is not in the first results   why   this question is not because bizview is my own app the question is for more   after changing to fullscreen and back the position of the window is wrong and not to influence right please create a possibility   please bring the dependencyproperty registerreadonly method in universal apps just like in wpf   i just wanted to say well done to microsoft for offering a very good browsing experience on wp with ie with ie was able to watch e g putlocker videos with no interference such as ads popping up on a friends android doing the same thing it kept popping up saying your phone has a virus   didn t do this on firefox or chrome   keep up the good work wp team and microsoft     in the windows data pdf api on implementing pdfdocument loadfromfileasync i receive an unspecified error after some diagnosis i found that the issue is caused by the api not handling pdf files encrypted with aes encryption that the later acrobat versions use   as aes encryption in pdf s is commonplace the api should be able to support it   i just found that reading the property of system comment from a file doesn t work on windows i used storagefile properties getdocumentpropertiesasync to read the properties of a file that has comment but documentproperties comment is a empty string   same problem happens to windows explorer set a new comment then apply to the file but when you read again there s nothing   dovrebbero fare una sveglia che si spegne con la voce   when playing a video using xaml mediaelement the cursor should hide automatically after some seconds   the same way that control panel does   an essential and very beneficial feature that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user example an app that allows users to select a time i e tomorrow am to do something   user can also choose to run everyday every week etc   i have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks and when i tried to implement scheduling i was surprised to see that this is not available on windows   timetrigger won t serve this purpose as it at least requires minutes slot it has the trigger time between and not on exact time   working on this request at the earliest would be really appreciated   this feature is available on android i heard even on iphone an essential and very beneficial feature that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user   example an app that allows users to select a time i e tomorrow am to do something   timetrigger won t serve this purpose as it at least requires minutes slot it has the trigger time between more   apis do not support the configuration of the window background colour this means that if like groove music an app uses a non white background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size   as someone who cares about attention to detail and delivering the best possible experience this sloppiness in the api is incredibly annoying   in windows phone x we had a nice photo auto upload capability that allowed an app creator to tie into the camera and automatically upload each pic that the user took   this was great because it allowed other services to get their apps in the store that magically replicated one s camera roll to the cloud service and allowed users to have a choice as to what cloud service they would use   in windows uwp that s completely gone you can use a win ph silverlight app to do it but that s not uwp at all we need to bring this functionality over to uwp especially since the onedrive space was disastrously cut in october and now users will want a different free service on to which to upload pics   there are workarounds of course like creating a timed background app that wakes up and looks at the camera roll for new stuff every so often but that is a polling approach which is always much less desirable and power efficient than an event driven one   thanks e in windows phone   x we had a nice photo auto upload capability that allowed an app creator to tie into the camera and automatically upload each pic that the user took   in windows uwp that s completely gone you can use a win ph silverlight app to do it but that s not uwp at all we need to bring this more   provision to play a audio video to multiple devices connected in same network or network segment   uwp still lags all features of regular ado to connect to any db using ef will only provide direct access to sqllite and not regular dbs ms shall change ef to allow db connectivity via batch data return like return records at a time instead of select returning entire db table data in one shot   without this feature definitely not all windows apps will be ported to uwp for the simple reason we don t want to write another azure service to handle db activity   currently windows os decides the best internet connection and uses it automatically if i have more than one connection like wifi and network cable need user setting option to override the same and assign one or more app to use specific network connection wifi and others to use other possible network connection g g this way the already paid for g g wifi network cable etc or for that matter i can take more than one provider s internet with variable speeds at home and connect to one pc and use it optimally efficiently   i m using win pro x and having problem when saving a mb mp file from my smart phone to desktop my pc becomes unresponsive i could not open task manager nor start menu even after restarting windows it keeps hanging after i login at the first time i didn t know to to fix the error so i had to factory reset my pc   lol everything was lost   for the nd time i used another os to go to my win desktop to delete the file   then my windows works fine   is there any fix for this problem   here is my desktop configuration cpu i k memory g of ram harddisk tb gb for windows gb for data i m using win pro x and having problem when saving a mb mp file from my smart phone to desktop   my pc becomes unresponsive   i could not open task manager nor start menu even after restarting windows   it keeps hanging after i login   at the first time i didn t know to to fix the error so i had to factory reset my pc   here more   add treeview control to uwp same as in system windows controls treeview   when assigning app licenses in the windows store for business wsfb end users always get notified   as this can become very annoying i m missing the option ability to disable end user notification when new apps has been assigned   right now it s unnecessarily hard to change the color of a pressed toggle button it would be a lot more convenient to have a simple property to set the pressed togglebutton color similar to how you set the background color of a control   ms edge is not bad however people have different requirements for web browsers the current webapis are too limited for developers to create a new browser you should give people more freedom and more apis to create new browsers and please don t always use security risk as excuse for not allowing people to create more creative apps than edge i d like to suggest that creating apis for allowing specify proxies in third party apps   more events support for webview for example gesture support allowing third party apps to processing the network input output like handling css javascript files image files stream files   allowing third party apps to manipulate dom elements   ms edge is not bad however people have different requirements for web browsers   the

pdb files extremely slowly   extensions don t work consistently on various versions builds of windows   etc   the solution is open sourcing windbg and related tools dbghlp windbg extensions etc which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at microsoft doesn t manage to   obviously microsoft will be the lead and changes such as extensions supporting parsing of new

for vb net withevents feature   in contrast to in c# the addhandler statement in vb net does not create a handler method   thus one has to manually dig through msdn to find the correct signature   the withevents clause in vb net allows to add handler methods the vs code designer by selecting the events from a combobox at the window top   some all   uwp classes seem not to support withevents   the vast majority of the documentation for the apis is auto generated descriptions of classes interfaces and so on there is practically no documentation on how classes class clusters and sub systems should or do work   for example with regards to controls there is no real explanation of their behaviour   a case in point being the contentdialog which lays itself out differently depending on what the text scaling value is set to   the more complex an api feature the less likely there ll be useful documentation on how to use it or how it behaves   a good is example of this is the richeditbox and all of its document manipulation capabilities which are undocumented beyond a basic listing of properties methods al   in comparison with ios the documentation for developing uwp apps is woefully inadequate   the vast majority of the documentation for the apis is auto generated descriptions of classes interfaces and so on   there is practically no documentation on how classes class clusters

because it would be nice to use the latest version especially since windows phone is still unfinished   with windows the mediaelement can t play audio in background anymore   we all have to use backgroundmediaplayer if we want the audio to continue even when the app is minimized   however the backgroundmediaplayer doesn t have all the features the mediaelement had   please add the support of audio effects e g equalizer etc to the backgroundmediaplayer api   don t let the wonderful windows uap be a downgrade on features   it doesn t even have to support the full range of mfts   just input pcm and output pcm would be enough   when you have a text editor with unsaved changes the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing this is not possible on uwp please add option to do that on uwp desktop apps   week passed after i published my app on windows mobile store and the link to the app in the store still isn t working i also published versions for android and ios

asked to add this issue here kindly look into the issue also would like to mention that i have matching word in my application name i was expecting that if people search for match then also it should work but unfortunately it seems to be searching whole word   i would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also or may be give an advance search option where people can tell where the word should be searched   for eg in publisher name or in application name whole word partial word and so on   i have posted my st application on windows store with keywords   however none of

search engine algorithm back to as it was to make it possible to actually find an app by its title i have made an app when i search for it apps pops up and my app isn t any of them   i just chatted to

because the transaction fee is to my country and the payout threshold is so if i earn let s say i get because of the transaction fees   if we can hold payouts we could hold them until we reach a reasonable amount and then pressing ok to pay out if you are allowed   today only windows phone store allows creation of beta and hidden apps   the windows dev center does not allow that   it is very important that we support beta for both windows phone and windows   the net core frame work is a cute idea but incorporate ideas that have caused me to avoid linux for the most part   picking and choosing from a utter mess of small packages to make one item work   core should be reserves for micro systems such as the raspberry pi   the date drop down in the windows dev center needs to have

ui test for a localized uwp apps test becomes dependent on texts that are localized on most controls this can easily be handled by an automationid but on the corewindow and messagebox incl   buttons you cannot set any automationid s so the coded ui test has the use the title to find the elements   please make support for setting set automationid on corewindows and messagedialog   include a ratemyapp for uwp control similar to ratemyapp control released by nokia for windows phone   this make it easy to implement and obtain rating saves time and can focus on app logic as opposed to mundane tasks   provide an oob control for standard store operations so that the developers can integrate these functionality more readily then writing code   for example a control that can allow developers to seek feedback from user directly   instead of making a new app update immediately available to everyone allow control in dev center to release to a percentage of users this allows developer to obtain metrics and feedback before opening the floodgates and reverting to previous version if necessary   could you put in an update to reduce boot time by seconds and make the start screen interactions smoother such as swiping from start to the list of all apps and could you reduce the time it takes for a windows app to open by second e g messaging phone etc   wp has all of the

the points i made are clear and can be of help to you and your community thankyou   could you put in an update to reduce boot time by seconds   and make the start screen interactions smoother   such

the microsoft lumia the multi tasking bit where you try to close the tab its not as smooth its a bit laggy   this could be fixed   if and when android apps or if they are used as a universal windows app   please could you organise them and put them into categories e g snapchat with social media etc   this could work   please microsoft improve the performance again with windows mobile   just like you did with which was a bit faster than windows phone   thanks i know you can do it if you really try   today i opened the windows dev account payout report i found up my advertising and my purchased app already separate into two why this happen i should get the total payout summary which include advertising and app that had purchased   included in the previous windows phone store description was a last updated field which would clearly let you know what the latest upload was   maybe add this to additional information   also the more from publisher was an easy way for the developer to promote one s other published apps   it was also nice to see your badges of honor in one place another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom showing related apps as long as they meet a certain review standard to promote cross visibility   add the support in the visual studio designer to preview another language than the app default language   currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that this publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps localstorage folder if you are careless during signup you are stuck and can t change the publisher id and therefore that naming of your packages   we would like to register as a developer in windows store   but bvi is missing in the list of countries   please add   i m still

button   https doc co yspoxj the link above is a sway that explains my suggestion better than i can do so here   i sincerely hope it makes a difference didn t know where else to give this suggestion as there is no live com uservoice   as the audiences from the business store and the retail app store are different it makes no sense that to publish to the business store you have to submit the app

all of the fields and a online translator i understand that having a translation is important but i am not a linguist i honestly think i learned programming before proper grammar i am a individual person making apps on my own and spending almost a whole day just to post the app descriptions is a big pain   maybe have a button next to each field where it would take the text from the primary description page   and put it onto the description field for japanese for example for my app i have it in about language country descriptions which is a big task to handle   the user could then review

uap   as you know online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days i may be overlooking it but it would beneficial to both devs and microsoft if windows universal apps had access to a universal server for networking apps together   this way low bandwidth overhead apps could implement multiplayer online interactivity   this might require some processing on the part of microsoft in the form of custom server processing of incoming and outgoing data but microsoft could add an additional charge for apps that take advantage of this feature to cover cloud computing storage costs   in short if low bandwidth mmos could be made which scaled in revenue and bandwidth according to how many of the apps are purchased in use   microsoft could recoup its costs by an extra overhead on sales of such applications   more apps sold more cloud processing and cloud data storage more revenue   less apps low cloud processing and data storage and less revenue   the point is having some sort of universal capacity to network apps together safely through a universal microsoft service to greater or lesser extents which would then be proportionally reflected in pricing relative to the amount of usage the apps need would open up developer capacity and increase variety on the store   as you know online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days

wp the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on save which then returns them to the app s code to handle the token returned   because this is sso for phone the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly   if i enter the wrong password then the ui for the credentials prompt does not leave the prompt screen because the password was not valid   this seems to be a serious security flaw with the api if it is allowing blank passwords to proceed as valid while wrong passwords are treated as invalid   i m using the

 please enhance the new back up function http blog feedly com dropbox vault and enable google drive integration   google reader api allows to create feeds like i e http www google com reader public atom user state com google starred   i can import this feed in wordpress or joomla so when i find an interesting article in google reader i simply star it with automatic pubblication in my blog   it would be very nice to have this in feedly   i know it works in ie now not sure about but definately not   i m forced to use ie on windows xp at work with no ability to install anything or use portable firefox etc   i m not the only one that has asked for this but comments are lost on closed general ie threads now that feedly works in ie   want to still be able to subscribe to twitter feeds without having to create twitter account   please make an option to login that does not include google   there are a lot of us who want anonomosity in what we are reading   we want it to be between feedly and us only especially now that the government is working to get open access to our google accounts   is this a recent change or something i ve just seen   i couldn t find any option in feedly extension to turn this off so i ve turned background apps off in chrome but would rather this be an option in feedly   i like that instapaper is an option but it s very clunky   clicking the instapaper button in feedly opens a new browser window on the instapaper site and then i have to wait for it to load my account and then i have to click another button to save the article   would be so much nicer if i just clicked the instapaper button in feedly and that was that   it would be cool if there were some way to receive notifications of new posts in the mac os x and ios notification center   doesn t suport the ie   i see blank page   please make update   today i opened chrome   haven installed the feedly extension i did notice that i has some weird tab that decided to add itself   not liking that i thought diabling the extension will solve this   no much problem surfing later i discover that i have to unpin the tab   also the tab does not stay unpinned   this is bad   i didn t put the tab there and i don t want it   get it off   you absolutely cannot do this   i don t care how many votes this suggestions gets if i see it happen again feedly will be dead to me   i will uninstall it everywhere and make it my life s mission to destroy it   i believe htc blinkfeed is getting a lot of users as well and it ll be nice if you guys can reach out to htc to get your apis working with their blinkfeed   i generate a majority of my google reader rss content from manually set up google alerts by setting up google keyword searches and selecting deliver to google reader   can you create a connection between google alerts and feedly so that when i update a feed in google alerts the change will be picked up by feedly   i would like to have the possibility to link readability to feedly   create kippt integration to allow sharing to kippt com   being able to follow reddit topics from within feedly   currently cloud feedly com works only with ie browser which is still rather new to the world especially corporate one   ie is too old and probably too many hacks to support it   but ie would be nice to support   is there any way i can save to pocket directly without opening a separate web page each time   google reader sends new articles every day as a periodical format do kindle mail address being able to send every subscriptions os just located in a folder   better than that would be an option to catch the article text and send it completely not just the resume from rss as some sites do somewhat like the instapaper does   create a separate registration login system independent of a google account   right now if i have two google accounts and separate chrome sessions one for work and one for personal use i cant use feedly across sessions   another win is that right now i have to generate my multi factor authentication code when i try to login to feedly on my ipad which is not always convenient for feed reading purposes   feedly looks nice but newsrob provides a significantly more useful experience for users with lots of feeds https play google com store apps details id com newsrob pro   allow a new version of newsrob to use the feedly backend api   promote feedly by having that version of newsrob being re branded with feedly logo   a desktop version that would integrate both online services facebook twitter pinterest with desktop services photoshop outlook messages   i prefer using the reeder on my desktop than feedly on the browser since it opens links on the app helping me focus on my reading   the ifttt ingredient articlecontent does not contain the full article body it saves the st paragraph or nothing at all   we loose the main goal of the use of ifttt   can you enable full article content from the original rss feed   integration with net news wire so we can keep updated on every mac i use nnw for publishing to my blog with marsedit   it would be great if feedly would provide the current count of unread articles to teslaunread which would show that number in the corner of the app icon on nova launcher   maybe you need to contact teslacoil software for information on how to implement that   as an alternative to that you could also create a x widget mimicking the app icon with unread counter   however the downside of that would be that you couldn t place this widget in a homescreen folder   this is very powerful feature   i suggest do it like it is done in the google reader watcher http ajnasz hu google reader watcher   additional the watcher provided notifications about a number of the unreaded articles   yes i know that the first build of mac os a u is as slow as a tortoise   burt the feedly extension seems to be horribly broken   create a webapp for ubuntu so feedly can be integrated into

painless updates   i would much rather be able to create a fluid app by using fluid in the normal manner   i just got the new chromecast and one of my first thoughts was that it would be cool to send movies from my feeds straight to the tv   i know i can watch them via mirroring on the computer but something more native would be appreciated   integrate facebook twitter youtube and other social accounts into feedly so i can read the timeline posts and other in feedly   like your facebook news feed could be a feed on feedly   new videos from users you subscribed to on youtube can be a whole feed like migrate the entire home page of your youtube account and put it as a feed here   and twitter tweets from your followers can be another feed   the opml export feature should include tagging data   i would like to be able to switch to another service without losing all of the tags i use to organize my source library   microsoft has a rss platform for a common store of rss feeds across ie and outlook   it would be nice to sync any feeds from that store to feedly   it would eliminate the need for an add on to ie as people can use the native button to have their feeds pulled into feedly   it would be great if there was a feedly plug in for the mozilla thunderbird email client   right now i can have several google apps open in separate tabs in thunderbird   so each morning i start my day with my inbox google calendar and google reader each in their own tab right there together in one app   i love that   with the fazing out of google reader it would be great if feedly could take its place in my third tab   i notice that when viewing full articles tumblr feeds work just great except for photosets   they seem to get out of order and the one in the top right is out of place   it s a minor thing but for someone who follows a lot of tumblr blogs it can get annoying   i know you can set a preference to save an article to a read later service instead of saving it to feedly but i like feedly s save feature within the apps   however sometimes i d prefer to send an article to instapaper readability or pocket and still have it saved in feedly   could you install something like that under the sharing options   have the app available in the for lion osx in the app store   http www spritzinc com about reading becomes more efficient because spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having to waste time searching for the next word   the direct posting from the feedly to the yammer is much preferred by many of enterprise business persons   currently we can only choose safari and chrome in options   it would be nice to open articles in the browser we actually use like mercury in my case   many of us use beyondpod as the go to app for pod casts   it was easy to integrate with google reader   perhaps a similar situation could be made with feedly   i subscribe to my youtube subscriptions in feedly and so much appreciate this feature   i find it easier to keep up with my subscriptions in feedly than in youtube   however most of the time i just want to get some of those videos added to my youtube playlist watch later   it would be awesome to have a click option to add any youtube video in any post directly to my youtube watch later playlist   i m not sure what the deal is with buffer but it seems like a needless step   for some unknown reason it decided to buffer my post until am tomorrow   what the heck   is there an actual reason you cannot share directly to facebook twitter anymore   is it not allowed   do you not have the proper agreements in place   can you get them   that would be wonderful   i m not the first person to post this   look it up   i dislike the fact that you have started to mask users bitly urls with your own feedly links   i realize that your link still pings my link and get the analytics but i have a custom url for a reason   i understand why you might do this for the free version of feedly but i implore you to not mask users custom urls in your upcoming paid pro version   would love a click add to instapaper rather than opening a new window yes i have a password and even the browser javascript bug   thank you   add feedreader to the app center list   right now it s connected to the wrong account i have more than one buffer accounts   there is no option to disconnect in any way   i already tried to reinstall the app   share directly with twitter instead of buffer   i am using this app for my ipad and yours for the iphone and laptop   it would be great if you could share the api with the developer allowing a seamless sync amongst the apps as it happens now with google reader   http mrreaderblog curioustimes de post supported google reader alternatives part two   deploy the latest version of feedly so that i can update the app on my kindle fire   it seemed like for a few days feedly was using chrome custom tabs instead of opening links in the external chrome app   it was a little jarring at first but once i realized what was going on i really liked it so why did you quickly remove that feature   so why did you quickly remove that feature   i understand that a lot of people who choose to have links open in chrome may not like it but i really liked having links be added to my chrome history while still feeling like i was in the feedly app   will you be making that an additional option along side open directly in browser   http getpocket com developer docs authentication   allow for default settings so that when this new defaulting mode is enabled clicking the evernote icon will save with no additional interaction   default tags would also be helpful even better configurable content keyword tagging would be great   have an option to make items open directly in the chrome browser on mobile   please make a feedly widget gadget for igoogle or equivalent   a chrome firefox extension that shows a counter of unread items with a dropdown that lets the user see the items   similar to the official reader notifier from google   there can be apps installed in system that catch http url and display its content inside itselves   built in browser of feedly brakes such behavior   pushbullet is an amazing sharing app   it pushes stuff from your one device to other as well as to other person   sometimes when i am reading a feed and i want to share it directly with a person it is very easy to to push it to someone   i know it already does that for android app well because android os lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when i hit share icon in the feedly app but it would be awesome to have it in the web app   basically instead of having to manually install the firefox plugin every time there s an update it should auto update   maybe you should consider including the plugin in the firefox addon repo marketplace   would be great to be able to read my feedly feeds on ighome com instead of having to go to feedly com   so flipbook sort of did this but they did it awful and i unistalled   yes i want feedly to replicate google reader but i want it to do more   can you bring in my twitter feed and know which one s i ve already read   i e do that google reader feedly does for rss but with twitter or facebook or pinterest   give me one place to consume everything but only see it once unless i save it   ohhh that would be awesome   feedly client doesn t support android so i was forced to use alternative android apps   i tried more than on my nook simple touch   and all of them have the same problem when trying to log into feedly   after entering google username and password i get onto the moved temporarily page   after clicking on the only link on the page i get an empty page   offering other ways to log in or even feedly s own registration system might also help   every time i restart chrome feedly mini appears on every web page   i want to turn it off   i ve updated my preferences which works until i close the browser and restart it then my preference is set to show it again   i have tried the greader and press android clients   both show we a google login in a web view within their apps   this is insecure because i cannot verify that i am not phished and that i am talking directly to google   such a login process should not be allowed   login should go through the google account stored on the android device   make the safari extension open the feedly page in a new tab window when clicking the feedly button similar to the safari greader extension   i didn t see anyone else suggest this but i would think it would be very simple for flip board to add support for your service   i see no reason why they wouldn t because i know they transferred over a bunch of google reader feeds but they aren t doing what feedly is   would be nice to have   would love the ability to monitor specific pages that don t have rss feeds at set intervals and be able to vary the alert options such as getting an email etc when the pages change   thanks and please keep up the great work   can i only not find it or is it really gone   since today i cannot send to instapaper anymore which was very useful for me   i am using safari   of my blogs are music blogs and i d say of posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them   to visit the sites externally for every page is not very convient   could u make this happen   google reader never did but i suspect that s because they quit investing r d into improvements   allow us to import twitter lists and view them like regular feeds   support login with twitter facebook microsoft yahoo vk account etc and remove google account login support   allow android app to provide an option to open within the application or open in a browser   i have read that you did have tumblr integration and then it was gone   like a send to tumblr button and liking posts from tumblr feeds   i assume there was problems with it but some of us really use it and it would be great to have it back   so far this is the best feed reader i ve tried   please consider it   thanks   on android devices it is hard to add new feeds to feedly   you can t use paste in the search bar field and you can t use feedly as a sharing option in other android apps dolphin browser etc   it is really annoying to remember every interesting site until i can use a desktop computer   please please add an option to easily add content by using a mobile device   thanks   make a chrome packaged app for feedly please   so i can launch feedly from google desktop app launcher   i m talking about just integrating my stream followed tumblrs that is reading not posting   i keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration but can t find it anywhere   i just want my tumblr content to show up as articles without having to add every single one as rss   i keep reading that that s possible but can t find any setting or even anyone explaining how it s done   if it is indeed possible maybe a short how to in the help section is in order   if it isn t that would also be great to have clarified somewhere faq maybe   youtube video work fine on feedly but somehow vimeo video is not showing the content instead showing error #   take a the verge for example   better support for podcasts   i use beyondpod on my android phone and it supported integration of sorts with feedly   my desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if i ve listened to a podcast completely from either source i e from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone that the episode would be marked listened to or read and disappear from the list in feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my beyondpod list   ideally if feedly and beyondpod could get together and synchronize the position within a podcast would be excellent   that said as a podcast player feedly leaves a lot to be desired   from what i can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to   furthermore if i am careless and click somewhere else like to read another article feedly will stop the playback and go to the place i clicked   it should warn me   finally a popout player would be nice for the audio video of podcasts   chrome extension required too much permission extension can access your data on all websites   please reduce required permission for chrome extension   work with soundgecko so anything i mark in feedly goes to soundgecko for readout   feedly should let users login through mozilla persona or gravatar which don t track users   persona is made by the makers of the firefox browser and gravatar is made by wordpress   i would like to change my log in for feedly so that it does not match my google account which contains other personal data   how   i cba to leave feedly but i want to know what other people are saying and i want to be able to contribute without signing up to anything   if a blog does use disqus the comments should be viewable and a reply able to be added directly from feedly   make app extension plugin for all browsers with one click to add feed from any website   there are some private blogs on wordpress com   you can subscribe to them in wordpress reader once you have access to them but you can t use them outside wordpress   when you could connect your feedly to your wordpress com account why shouldn t you be able to subscribe to them   i don t know if wordpress has an api for this   i guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service   even though i m logged in to google in the same browser and i ve already logged in to feedly with my google account and granted access to use what it wants it still keeps logging me out then making me go through this process every couple of days why   i wish as feedly pro user if i save the feeds in evernote i want to tag the note not only the notebook but also the tag of evernote   the utm parameter added to your links breaks them at some sites   case in point new york magazine   creating a win win situation for readers and content creators   further thoughts feedly could develop subscription options for content creators   i e feedly handles payment and delivery of information creator creates information and receives revenue   readers get access to contribution only content   it s been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others   i would like to see better integration with google services across the board specifically gmail google and google drive   i would like the ability to email articles with gmail post them to google and save them to google drive cause google doesn t own quite enough of my soul yet   though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services like google translate i ve not seen it expressed generally   this option existed before   now i have to go the the source article to have the option to post to a linkedin group   it s a relatively minor detail but it would be really convenient   import rss from other readers   beyond pod is my main feed reader when i m not on my computer   i like it because of its built in browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts which the google reader app didn t have   please consider speaking to the people of beyond pod to integrate with their app   feedly is beautiful and i would love to use it on my windows phone   allow publishers to trigger feedly to refresh feedly s cached version of their rss feeds   feedly doesn t seem to notice when existing feed content for a date time changes and refresh their cache   letting publishers trigger that refresh could be a work around when there are errors in the publisher s feed   add integration with trello   evernote sharing in feedly seems to cause the chrome evernote plugin to sign out the user and then feedly takes you to a web page version of evernote rather than using the evernote plugin clipper to push it directly into the application or push it transparently to the web   i just see a blank screen on ie   since i ts my work computer i can t control the software upgrade   if you don t fix that i will seriously consider droping feedly   chromecast support would be great so i could read my news on big screen   i love how you have pintrest integration on your images please consider adding gimmebar integration as well   the type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day   great app   gimme bar https gimmebar com   as above   i d love to be able to export all of my saved for later articles to my kindle so i can read it via e ink   i used to subscribe to instapaper s premium service and it exported all of my articles into a kindle book with a table of contents etc   i feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service that s already up and running like sendtoreader com or i would gladly pay to have the option for feedly to do it on it s own and send to my kindle   feedly allows folder order to be rearranged instead of appearing in alphabetical order   this is useful to me as i d prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the all items view   i changed the folder order via the feedly web interface organize but the changes in folder order are not being reflected in mr reader   i logged out of then back into the feedly account in mr reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order   please enhance your api   i rarely use google plus but there are few very interesting people using it who s post i d like to read   for example linus torvalds   on feedly android app when i share something through email it goes straight to gmail app when i rather want to use the regular email app on that plataform   make it possible for us to choose the mail app we want to use   as a feedly users we all know the pain of having to deal with truncated feeds   this problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely on feedly like press on android   i would like to request the capability to run articles through the readability mobilizer before they re inserted into our feeds   this would help to solve the problem of truncation and poor article formatting   i have missed the email subscriptions feature of the old pre bloglines ever since they discontinued it   i would gladly become a feedly pro subscriber if you offered something comparable   in a nutshell you could create a bunch of random email addresses that you could use when subscribing to newsletters etc and then any emails sent to one of those addresses would show up as a standard html feed   this was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their rss feed or lack an rss feed completely   a perfect use case for this would be to turn twitter facebook etc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox   this could be used for any of these closed services which do not offer rss feeds   the closest solution to this i have found is to use mailinator to create the throwaway emails and they support rss feeds but they also strip out all images attachments etc and generate plain text feeds so this isn t a good solution   please consider adding this type of feature to feedly   in igoogle there was the google reader gadget   one of the very popular alternatives to igoogle is netvibes com   it would be cool if there was a feedly gadget for netvibes   oembed is a format for allowing an embedded representation of a url on third party sites   eagerly waiting on connection with evernote   there are my tags i use daily   the way flipboard has implemented twitter is that it grabs the content in the tweet and displays it so rather than a user having to click a link to read an article or view an image it simply gets the article content or image and displays it with any text of the tweet acting as a caption   it would be great if i could integrate my twitter account into feedly the same way and have full images or articles displayed alongside my rss images and articles   soundgecko is a great way to be able to listen to articles that you want to read later while in the car or on the go   i use it every day   i would love to have direct integration so that i can easily send articles to soundgecko from within the feedly app   i ve only noticed this on two feeds my own blog and xkcd s   in both cases what should be a float left is actually changed in the code to a float right   see attached   this does not occur in google reader where the original layout displays normally   since the attribute isn t changed in reader i concluded that the problem is with feedly not the rss feed itself   please enhance the new back up function http blog feedly com dropbox vault and enable local drive integration   this would allow anyone to back up to dropbox googledrive synology cloudstation microsoft onedrive or any other cloud solution which has a local drive representation in addition to allowing me to save it on a local machine   i can login into my account for the past days   i was logging in using my google credentials   the oauth screen is popping up and hanging   it would be nice to be able to add usenet newsgroup in add content such as comp   mailing list would be great as well great job   something like antennapod https play google com store apps details id de danoeh antennapod would be very nice   maybe you could send them an api or something so they can add the option to sync with feedly once greader disappears   it would be super useful if you are able to choose your own default email app   not everybody uses the gmail app as default some others use cloudmagic mailbox inbox k and such   please guys make it happen   i cannot login to my feedly account using windows microsoft edge even after deleting all cookies etc   i can still login with iexplore   i cannot tell if this is a problem with edge or with feedly   google reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category label used   is very useful for sharing feeds using it with wordpress blogrolls ecc   it would be great if google button opened an app on ios if it is installed   i used google reader to get the best posts from many blogs and share them through my own blog hosted in blogger   google reader had the option send to blogger   that s the only feature i m missing in feedly   i can add my tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if i want to like them i have to open the page in another browser window   it would be nice if we could get the tumblr heart right in the feedly page like how we can save for later   reblog support would be nice too but mostly just like at least   i know of many folks including yours truly who use feedly in conjunction with pocket   i noticed that buffer and evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the web interface   my feature request is rather straightforward add a similar shortcut for save to pocket   for example if you want to have a feed with a particular tracked tag from tumblr feedly could create a feed   for example if you want a feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags #retail #design http www tumblr com tagged retail design would be a feedly feed   the current version of your chrome web app does not behave correctly when you click the icon of a chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the chrome launcher or maximize it from there feedly s web app however keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it   the current version of your chrome web app does not behave correctly   when you click the icon of a chrome web app this should bring an existing open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the chrome launcher or maximize it from there   that can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this google being the stupid other exception of the rule   please fix this by updating the manifest json file inside the app   it should be enough to make the urls match the actual url of the open app   so in case you switch to https do use that in the manifest too   currently if there s a link to an app in the google play store it opens in the feedly browser instead of using the play app which is frustrating   this is just one example of many so it seems to be a problem with opening in the browser only   we should have the choice   for instance feedpress can t see how many people subscribe to feeds through feedly   please allow some way for rss services to get access to that data especially since feedly is so big   right now it s a black box   fix it if you can   how about giving feedly compatibility with if this then that   posting to pocket via the chrome extension is currently very laborious opens in a separate tab then loads all your pocket stories every time   pending more straightforward integration with pocket how about allowing us to send our entire saved list straight to pocket   you reader is nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing vimperator pentadactyl please replace all links you emulated with divs eg menu on the left with real hrefs so these are found by such tools   let the content creators see that their content is viewed in your service like http feedburner google com   i add rss source by click the rss icon on the url bar on chrome but with feedly i can t do it   please make a way to do that   rendering is messed up in ie and   i m super grateful that you guys got it working at all by july st but this is something that will need to be fixed   when showing news as just title lines in chrome it ll show title per line so to say and the st line of the article is revealed after the title or upon clicking on it   in ie every news line is effectively lines line for the title then the st line of the article starts and goes on for a full nd line   this looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my rss   again super grateful you guys got it working somewhere other than chrome a life saver since i can only use ie on my windows rt tablet but this needs to be fixed eventually   when saving to pocket in this case a third party app having visual feedback that the save is happening would be useful   i have performed a save multiple times as its not always instant a limitation of integrating with a third party i understand   maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved   now that we have a wonderfully awesome evernote integration it s time to make it easier to use   i have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so i can simply click the evernote icon and voila the article saved to my default notebook   when i send content from feedly web to evernote the formatting comes across wonky and unclear   when i send it from other similar tools like mr reader it comes across as an article and without the extra content from the website   i wish to add content in evernote with the clearest formatting i can so it needs to be better than feedly currently supports   many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make feedly a pure web based app   so do i   if you re not going to please explain why not   what i really want are gmail style filters for feeds to automatically star or mark as read based on matches   a typical example if article subject contains this week in mark it as read   if article body contains my name star it and send to instapaper   i think ifttt integration could get us there with not too much in the way of additions add trigger with pattern or keyword matching on subject sender body etc add mark as read as an action   it should be possible to specify actions in ifttt that mark articles as read when triggered   i would like to do some action when new articles show in some categories but i don t want to see them anymore in feedly after this action is executed   lots of blogs contains latex code to display mathematical characters   this should display as the characters themselves rather than just as the code   alpha should be the greek letter alpha and so one   this would make it much easier to read philosophical and mathematical blogs   pages created with wordpress allow this   this would allow you to minimize the rights required for users interested only in the reader   keyword filtering deleting articles authors not of interest prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by ifttt   some tumblrs i read have passwords on them   it d be great to have a way to add these feeds to feedly by allowing us to enter the password once from feedly   make it possible for me to open articles and links inside articles in safari from within feedly   i am looking for something like this but for feedly https chrome google com webstore detail checker plus for google r lbmpmiibbncadgagnfcloaeilfhomemb   create delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious com   the side area allows you to include your facebook and twitter feed   if you re using feedly as your homepage a quick overview of upcoming events might be nice   please let me sign in with an id and password i chose not my google account   i d like to connect articles with items in my calendar   e g i read an article about concert and add an item to calendar attaching link to article   or i read an article about grant or scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link to article   i m limited to ie on windows xp at work   all i get is the same white screen all the ie and ie users are complaining about   is there anything you can do to make feedly work on ie   hi few day ago i have started using you excelent app but one thing annoying me   my favorite web page which id http lodz naszemiasto pl rss artykuly xml is not acceptable by your app   could you fix it   hello feedly developers here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators   flattr is still not lifting mainly due to a lack off content creators willing to register themselves at flatter   also flatters prototypish content search function makes it hard for users to find proper content   feedly has a user friendly interface with a pretty reliable search function and share options to several other applications   it might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly   alternatively a simple flattr inspired donate function might do it   feedly pro readers sign up for the donate option where they can donate an amount of money for articles they liked   the amount of the donation is up to the user the user pays in advance into his pro account and may spend that money for article donations   as a feedback a graphical representation of number and amount of donations and how many readers have read and or donated a certain article is shown   in this way the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent   all articles can be donated too   the donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations similar to unclaimed flatters   bloggers authors who want to claim their money do this by registering their rss feed and bank or paypal account at feedly   after registration unclaimed donations will be transferred from donator to author   feedly keeps a certain percentage of the donation as an administration fee   benefits gives readers an easy way to support the authors and content they like   gives content creators an additional revenue model   gives feedly an additional revenue model   opens up further possibilities around subscription paid only content contributors influencing content creators etc   feedly could re invent the way we consume articles in the same way how amazons kindle unlimited did with the book market   an easy to use donate function might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for fact based quality news   this function might change the independent news market in a similar way as amazons kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account   anyway the most important feature is to find the simplest way to transfer money from article readers to article authors   feedly could be the perfect platform for that   i have two twitter accounts that i use regularly one for work and a personal account   i often post to both from feedly but this requires a lot of logging in and out   integration with tweetdeck would allow me to easily post to either account   i often want to read articles at a later time in safari s readling list   would love to have a direct link to do this   do you think it s possible to mod this little software google reader notifier by yonizaf http code google com p google reader notifier windows to notify us when new feedly feeds are available   currently in browser and mobile version one has often to do two step navigation to go to original content e g youtube rss for uploads in browser and mobile version it embeddes video which is not what some of us want   i prefer to see original content most of the time so along with mark as read save links there could be url link which will drive to the original site   applies to browser and mobile versions   it would be awesome to play all videos one by one like in a playlist but without a hassle of creating one   i often have many short videos which i have to click individually which is pretty annoying when i want to do sth else and not touch computer   feedly is a website   luakit is a browser   i should be able to use feedly in luakit   i understand that offline support is being worked on and can t wait to use that functionality however since google reader is shutting down within weeks and byline reader is the only offline reader currently available for commuters it would be fantastic if you could work together   unfortunately they only pull their feeds from google reader   the android app is missing a mark as unread option   it would be great if you could add a link bookmark right into your diigo account while reading in feedly   i am a blogger and i want to make it easy for people to subscribe by having a flare unit for them to add my feed to their feedly but i simply cannot find a working flare unit to add to my feedburner   and i seem to be having trouble making one of my own   please create and host a flare unit and provide the url for bloggers to easily add this option for their readers who use feedly   sina weibo is a service like twitter in china it has biggest market share   i can use flipboard to access my feeds in sina weibo but i like feedly better so if it can be done in feedly it will be great for me   now it shows recent items which makes it unusable   i cannot see more and have to go to fb website anyway so the integration is not useful at all   the button to subscribe to rss with feedly in firefox actually does nothing   some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action   because feedly s swipe action moves to the next feed its not possible to view the slideshow   either allowing a function to go to a webpage in your internet browser outside of feedly or using another action to view the slideshow   other similar apps have this functionality it would be quite useful to my workflow at least   since you can integrate with twitter it would be nice to have my saved links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in feedly   i d like to have feedly automatically detect youtube videos in feeds and if i save a post with a youtube embed automatically add that specific video to my watch later feed in youtube   this way i can pull up the youtube app on my phone or tablet later and watch these videos on my chromecast   make the feedly reader browser extension more like the google reader extension   add a drop down menu of the sources with number of unread items in list the latest unread articles in a scrollable manner and add a mark all as read button and the link to the feedly reader   maybe you could also add a link to the preferences and please make sure that clicking a link to an article marks it as read in feedly thanks   footnote popovers as used on many popular blogs and wikipedia display the footnote itself within a pop up bar or text bubble right next to the main article text it relates to   in a properly formatted rss article the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online   can feedly s rss parser be made to not break this functionality please   i want to open feeds outside of feedly sometimes and look at the site it came from   i prefer to use chrome and it crashes constantly in feedly on my ipad if i browse beyond the article s page   it s a more stable option that selecting chrome as the preferred browser in feedly   also we should have the choice i m not going to leave feedly it s a great app   just looking for an option that let s me list my articles from oldest to newest like i have it in the on the site   i m looking for a consistent experience   i currently use newsblur but i d love to transfer all my feeds via opml to feedly   unfortunately feedly s opml support is artificially limited to google reader s exact opml format but there s no reason we can t expand it to handle newsblur s opml download format for importing into feedly   let us configure the directory and file names when saving to dropbox with tokens like year month date feed name post date etc   when you click on an rss feed in firefox it shows you a preview of the current feed with an option to subscribe to it   but the current add on doesn t add an option to the list of programs to subscribe using   i ve tried adding it manually but it doesn t work and in any case it shouldn t be that awkward   also would be nice to petition firefox devs to have it as standard   please remove unsaved items from dropbox or add a preference   would also mitigate this   allow all your saved for later items to be exported as a bookmark file in a similar format to the firefox and google chrome bookmarks export tool   this will allow bulk importing of saved for later items into tools like pinboard in   i just cant use the chrome extrension   it won t allow me to log in the window containing the form is closed as soon as the form has finished loading   i love feedly it s a really well programmed app   nevertheless there s one thing that annoys me   when i press a link in an article that i m reading on feedly then the link will always open inside feedly   there is no option to open the link directly in the browser safari or in my case chrome   sometimes it s necessary to open links in the browser out of convenience and sometimes for usability   usually i end up opening the link in feedly wait for the site to load and then i go into the options menu to open the site once more in chrome   it would be so much easier just to have a context menu item that gives the option to open a link directly in the browser   support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same as igoogle   when i switch in ios to another application e g to translate a word and switch back again the reader goes to a title page instead staying on the page i was reading which is not pleasant   possibly some translation functionality might be useful   we can set the preferred browser on ios this rocks   however if i then click on sharing and google plus it opens in safari   my suggestion is to honour the preferred browser if chosen when using more generic based web sharing services   i do not need all the pro features   i d love to pay year just for evernote integration though   this function is currently available in the gmail and pocket ios apps in which a button appears at the top left corner of the chrome browser which will allow the user to quickly return to feedly when they view a page in chrome from feedly   more convenient than using multitask function   integration or support to work with net news wire for mac and reeder and instapaper for ios   recently there was a change that forced you to use a buffer account to share to social networks such as facebook   seems kind of pointless for those who don t have a buffer account nor want one to have to create an account and have it be the middleman between feedly and facebook   i loved the way facebook sharing was   clean at the end of articles and available for comments before posting   if it ain t broke don t fix it   feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead of bringing up a mail client   i want that feature back as i would like to mail my articles directly   the g hack does not work for mailing lists   when i tag an article in feedly i want the tags to follow when i export the article to evernote with the built in evernote feature for feedly pro plan   as it is now when i export with the evernote button an article i have to manually log in to evernote and ad the tag again   it would be nice if we were able to view content from twitter embeds such as images in feedly   some libsyn feeds don t link to the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly   you used to be able to right click on the item in feedly and save it   now you have to open the file and use save page as   please fix this   beeline reader full disclosure i m the founder has browser plugins that apply eye guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier   over of people find that these gradients improve readability and the plugins work great on feedly   but the beeline functionality could be built into the feedly ui using the beeline javascript library   add google as option for feed that appear on the left in the app and also in your main feed   when we long press on a link in feedly or in a web view we re given the option to add it to reading list but not to instapaper or any of the other read later services   when you select a preferred rl service it should also be available when you long press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service rather than having to open the link wait for it to load then send it to instapaper or pocket or whatever you prefer   i have searched high and low google duckduckgo feedly com which redirects me to my feeds from where there are no other links pimpmysafari dead link apple s safari extension gallery everywhere   i see people talking about the extension all over the place but for the life of me i cannot locate a link to the damn thing   the abillity to export an article or post directly to kindle or and other e book readers   in the firefox extension selecting oldest first under change layout doesn t stick   it keeps resetting to unchecked so the sort is newest first the next time you enter that category   import google current feeds into feedly   add ability to share whole articles to evernote   this option is very important when rss feed contains only text excerpt   make feedly more sandboxed   android feedly chrome   i have a chrome icon in the action bar   i think its for open in browser or maybe share with chrome   anyway it d be great if this opened the currently visible article in the browser instead of the previous article   that s how it used to work and i think that makes more sense   sometimes after i ve clicked into an article into a chrome tab and then clicked the back button i end up at the feedly app s top level rather than at the article summary   i m presented with the feedly app s splash screen along the way   as is one has to open each post one wants to read later   often i have little time and just want to scan headlines and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile   unify login feedly allowing access by more than one source or facebook or google or microsoft or   just depending on what the user decided accounts relate   i would like the feedly chrome app to act just like the google reader one shows how many feeds i have and i can click on them individually   add the number of followers to your subscribe button like bloglovin already does to be displayed on blogs   provide the html code with your other buttons   integrate twitter cards on article preview page so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all its information it shows the card instead of plain text   when i save an article to evernote the resulting note is the text and images but not what the webpage looks like   the evernote web clipper allows to me save the full page but i would love to be able to do this straight from feedly   i currently use pocket as my read later app but was hoping to move to evernote   right now it takes clicks and navigating to another tab for saving to pocket it would be nice if it s handled in the same window with pop up or just with single click   also if it s possible to override save for later to pocket   i d like to have feedly integrate with bit ly   bit ly s bookmark function combined with it s url shortener and usage information would be really useful when sharing from feedly   please allow chrome feedly and other browsers feedly to customize favourite saving tool so that i can save to pocket with one click and please also cut the settings on the pocket s end for adding a new item   would be most appreciated   i currently use gread widget to see my unread count on google reader   it s how i get notified that there is unread items while i am on the mac   essentially i d like to see the ability to add all to an external application such as desktop ticker by mike batt   this application and greader pro for android is where i pull all my news in normally and desktop ticker is now useless as of this morning without a way to pull feedly or digg reader   might have to check to see if they have its data into it   i like the feedly interface more than the instapaper interface   i would like to read my instapaper saved articles via feedly   we use feedly and the buffer link in a work environment   i have googled and found at the moment feedly only works on one web browser which is google chrome   we are limited to one browser which is internet explorer in our work environment so we are currently unable to use your services   please can you give us a fix or enable your program to work in ie   other user s who are using your program for work purposes will have a similar problem as it makes it difficult for it teams to support more than one browser   i d like to be able to save articles to mindsky similar to other integrations   as available with their save tool http sky mind im   it s frustrating that i don t need to remember passwords anymore when i m using safari but i need to exit feedly go to settings safari passwords look for the site copy password go to feedly again and paste password   apply the awesome mobile app feature to the web interface   i would love to be able to save directly to pocket like i can on the android app   all is in title   when a term is added should lookup for feeds in popular rss feed directories in one go   this will present with more options to subscribe to   as a web developer i do not like plugins that add elements to the dom of each page   can you use a traditional address bar button   simple timeline were you can add content from twitter accounts facebook sites profiles in a own categorie   i m working on a feedly application and i want to add some pro features like in stream search but i m not able to test these because i don t have a pro account   so my suggestion is to offer developers a switch to turn on off pro features in the sandbox   obviously this should be somehow restricted so that this system can t be abused   feedly always inserts quotation marks in posts to buffer   please remove the quotation marks or make buffer post template editable like already the twitter post template   the use case is that i m surfing the web and i find a site that i d like to follow   i drag the url to my feedly bookmark and feedly adds the feed to my account even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as i add it   the ability to let indigo read the title of the posts perhaps with commands to marks as unread save even read the whole article like an interactive radio   you recently added function and allowed us to save an article to evernote that s great   however evernote s service for china is not supported   please do not abandon market in china   please remove google requirement   it would be great if chrome and opera weren t the only options for opening up articles in   i m using your chrome app   due to the way your article popup is positioned its close button sits directly above the side pane   although my mouse click is properly sent to the close button any mouse movement after the popup goes away is sent to the side pane which causes it to intelligently expand and reflow the list of articles that i am trying to read   it s really annoying   i really love how i can browse the latest articles from all feeds on the ios version but this doesn t seem to be an option on the chrome web app version   i might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment   keep the awesome work up guys   at some point can we get google keep integration to go along side pocket   that is if they have an api for it   i have a jabber account googletalk   i would like to receive the headlines as items arrive to my im client   as soon as i log in online your jabber bot could return to looking as defined in the settings of fresh news headlines   if i m already connected the bot could write headlines with links to me upon receipt of the news in my rss subscription   my facebook page is blocked by the plugin   i uninstalled all plugins and i only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure   if i have a feed in a folder named cooking i would like the ifttt ingredient entitled articlecategories to return cooking   currently it returns nothing   please make an app for blackberry playbook because there are no apps that support feedly on blackberry app world for playbook   this would make integration with other stuff eg newsbeuter possible   this could make the feedly opml a canonical source of feeds for other apps that a user wants to use   reset the rss subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension   the current uninstall leaves several settings in your about config and makes other changes which make it impossible to subscribe using live bookmarks anymore   i ve had to switch back to feedly just so i can subscribe to new feeds   for me it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser it brings chrome to the foreground and opens the link i tapped in a new tab   to get back to feedly i have to back out or go into recent apps   what i want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open n tabs in the background then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure   having tap always open a foreground tab is okay but probably better to be configurable   however if in article title view allow long press to bring up a menu   open in new external browser tab   at least allow configuring the action for long press   a lot of the rss feeds i read force you to go to the full site to read the full article   lifehacker is a good example   one thing that would be nice is the ability to be able to hit one button to open all of the unread articles for a category in new browser tabs rather than having to click each one separately   it would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to pocket or an alternative read it later app pocket all or something like that   if i want to subscribe to tumblr blog assume rss at the end of a link i paste i now have to manually add rss to links like http spaceyspacelifeisneat tumblr com to subscribe   the good read tagline isn t attached to my twitter posts when i schedule the posts through buffer   please add this feature   make it possible to link an article to your facebook business page   right now feedly isn t consistantly running across browser this needs to be investigated and fixed   i work which adivertisement so i like to seeing new video ideas but when i try to see vevo video on the feedly i never can only youtube videos   i m constantly missing important content that happens in google as i don t check it regularly   the unfortunate thing about this is that if i had an rss feed i d include it in feedly but google does not offer this   it would be great if there was a way to see all of the content i d see in google via the api and present it in feedly   being able to add a click feed for facebook https www facebook com help would also be quite useful   i have noticed that it is difficult to add new blogs that i want to follow including my own   when i search for emi ito illustration or the website www emiitoillustration com nothing comes up   this is the case even when i have subscribed to the blog through feedly through the feedly button on my blog   would be cool if i could view the basecamp progress feed in feedly   i use the saved items while on mobile to flag items for review on pc   it would be nice to have an indicator on the chrome extension icon to remind me if i have saved items to review   i need huffduffer integration to send selected audiofiles from within my rss feeds to this service   worked perfectly in google reader   depends on connections and permits their are not just one profile related posts   it requires an integration with google api perhaps even cooperate with google to make this specific data accessible   ie version   with ie and later in windows and windows you can drag a web site url from the address bar to the taskbar and pin the site to your taskbar for easy access   this makes for quick access to the site   imo it also helps with the brand of the site as the app is front and center for the user and feels like any other application   web sites like tweetdeck pandora facebook bing etc all include this functionality   most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon   when viewing feeds from dribbble com i would like to have a like button that is integrated with the like mechanisms from their site   when browsing a site with rss and atom metadata header the chroma and firefox plugin presents a transparent button to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to feedly   could the same be added to safari   having a pop up window open is pretty clunky   should just be able to click the icon and assuming the account link is active signed in send to readability   it would be really helpfull to have a feature of that shortens articles like summly or wavii   furthermore it ll have to be compatible with any rss feed i have in my list   for that kind of feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly i would love to pay because it makes my reading faster   recently the visit website launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything   you can launch safari from the internal button but then you have to bounce back and forth between apps   this works fine on the iphone but not on ipad   so i am using url for recent uploads from a youtube account example https www youtube com playlist list uuispcad svnxgvivr syva   the page from the url loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing to that url in feedly is missing out some videos for example i can t see video europa universalis iv common sense multiplayer on the feed   it was uploaded yesterday thought feedly shows some videos before it and after it why that one is missing   not sure if that s youtube only related spotted it with yt   that s really bad though we might be missing some random content and noone would know about it   please use feedly users rather than google s users   i suggest a feedly to google calendar feature   i saw a tv preview for a show next week and i want to be reminded regarding this feed entry   it will be great if you will develop a windows software for those who would like to read their feed on the computer   or at least make the browser extension useful firefox add on has no use   i want a one stop shop for all of these aspects of my internet life   it would also mean that i dont have to try and search for the video channels im subscribed to on youtube within feedly   i just click subscribe and they appear in my feedly   same for tumblr twitter and facebook   something similar to flipboard s functionality except your feed reader is immensely better than theirs   i d like to plug feedly into mac s rss screensaver but believe there is no way to do it   i would like to be able to thumbs up or down videos from my youtube feeds from within feedly   also allow a youtube video to continue to play while i scroll through the rest of my feeds   please add evernote support to the iphone for pro users   why was it necessary for us all to have   cloud version but no option or explanation at any time that all my feeds have gone   first of all i love feedly   i d like to suggest reverting the change that was made in last version regarding the safari browser stuff   i use my phone with left hand and feedly was great thumb would scroll swipe touch to open articles   once in the article whether within feedly or in safari i would press the back button top left   now the change has me reaching top right for the done button   disappointing from a ux perspective cause before it was perfect and seemless gets worse with bigger phones of course   i use evernote to store all of my note and picture from web pages   it would be great to have some integration with that app   feedly v fails to post to twitter from ios needs to be fixed   the share icon can prevent a user to click on something behind even if it s a small icon   and i play some times with javascript and it s influence by my script but in the extension bar it won t bother my script anymore   same for debugging webpage   and or you can make it a keyboard shortcut s   integration with offline translator dictionary is highly needed such as goldendict just add an icon to open the dictionary when pointing to a word in an artical   to view the full article via the visit website or by clicking the title freezes the loading of the page within feedly browser   add ui element a o shortcut to quickly add reference to default evernote folder w t popup dialog or confirmation   hi i really enjoy using feedly nextgen on windows phone and was excited to see the workflow with onenote which i already use for all my other note taking   however it seems that the selection of where to save any given article to onenote on windows phone always uses the default section set in onenote and not the one specified in the path when activating my onenote account   i am running windows phone lumia denim on a nokia lumia with nextgen reader   api connectivity to all google apps for work   add read later to the desktop extensions   i just wish i could archive and group or send to another read later app from there to organize   i ve been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart   i ve updated my ipad and now can t use feedly with buffer at all   i ve tried deleting apps and different configuration but impossible   why don t you test your blasted products before launching changes   you alienate your users and then impossible to get any sort of service to fix the problem   to import an opml file still shows a link to http cloud feedly com but the link is redirecting   so prey make it clear that this functionality does not exist or tell us how to import a and opml list   when i visit certain ogg based podcast feeds such as http thebugcast org the embedded player shows as a video rather than an audio player and the player controls do not work   in order to listen to the podcast i have to open the ogg file in a new tab and use the firefox embedded plater   need support to add articles in pocket directly   this can be added alongside twitter google and other buttons   like many others i want to add some twitter feeds as rss feeds   there are several older threads on this issue with some suggestions that no longer seem to work   to feedly can you please provide this type of service perhaps within you pro account if there are extra overheads   and can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the urls embedded in the tweets   it would be good to not have to link to twitter to get a usable url   currently i use a workaround http gtweetapp appspot com but it would be nice to have this feature in feedly   i m wondering what the latest solutions people are using to read twitter feeds in feedly   when techbargain com updated their site it no longer worked with feedly   i use google auth for both pocket and for feedly   i can log in to feedly that works fine   i chose pocket as my preferred saving tool   when i try to save to pocket though i get please configure   in the pocket settings i only seem to have the ability to set a pocket username and password   i can t find any way to configure pocket to use google auth   is it possible to use google auth to save to pocket from feedly on android   i want to be able to just log into feedly and not have it log me out if i log out of google   bring back tap saving to pocket in ios apps   when i use the define option in ios in ipad deeply opens a new window instead of showing a pop up   opening the word definition ins new windows does not make sense specially in an ipad   safari seems to have broken the toolbar   is that going to be fixed   hi i go smoothly feedly web version and android but windows desktop not mobile i do not get i log   i tried with kara and nextgen reader reader   please don t open a browser every time i want to share a post to my social networks google facebook   flipboard has a awesome way of doing it but your rss management is far better   please add wiznote support as you support evernote   hasn t been updating craiglist feeds for awhile even though outlook and ighome are updating those same feeds   the rss markup of these feeds identifies the author e g dc creator use that to set the author attribute for the evernote note   if author isn t available than set author to name of the site or blog   when using feedly on a mobile device location information becomes available to the app as well   could feedly also set these note attributes when exporting to evernote   perhaps other additional attributes   tags could be good and bad depending on how a user uses evernote   that being said exporting tags as well could be a master setting someone could toggle on or off basically improving the depth of integration with evernote   currently feedly syncs with google reader   since google reader is going away on july st i think it would be an awesome if feedly sync s with theoldreader it would be a great partnership for both of you   i just noticed that when i tried to view an rss feed from blogspot it automatically prompted feedly to show the feed   i m a web developer and i just wanted to copy the url of the feed   is there a way to toggle this automatic feature   if not can you offer it   add integration with toodledo   the new feedly ios ipad app integration with safari is fantastic but please allow a simple left to right swipe to take you from an article you have finished reading in safari back into feedly instead of having to use done at the top of the safari browser   i think my subject says it all   my hypothesis what people read is important for a prospective employer   a list of my rss feeds should be available as a public shareable list that i can attach to a cover letter and let the company i interview for create a better picture as a person   same as an integration for linkedin   not individual articles list as a whole   think group list on linkedin   allow to pin things to pinterest   if i could add individual users as a feed then i could see their updates without having to scroll through facebook s ridiculous wall   the same for twitter   just being able to add a twitter account and view only a single user s tweets would easily make feedly one of the best twitter platforms there is   please prevent duplicate saved items in dropbox   for feedly pro users when a pdf is generated for depositing in dropbox for later reading that you offer an option for whether bookmarks are auto generated inside feedly s pdf   adobe acrobat doesn t allow the user to set an option to perma hide the bookmarks pane and i guestimate that of the pdfs feedly pro generates only have one bookmark the article title   it s annoying to have acrobat auto open a useless bookmark listing one entry in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the pdf   this is way more adobe s ui problem than yours   feedly to google plus causes the feedly app to crash back to the home screen on kindle fire   pointemy domain to feedly   visitors can see www domain com   when we want to email news or feed records feedly do it via outlook it is better to send it via gmail or make an option for it   i use rockmelt as browser and feedly won t load he loads just fine in google chrome but i would like to be able to use it with rockmel   i would like to be able to send articles to clipboard com   right now when you has x news articles and when you read them by scrolling for ex and then click refresh when no new articles badge not disappear it remain with x   why the need access to data on all websites   this item can read every page that you visit your bank your web email your facebook page and so on   often this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for rss feeds that you might want to subscribe to   two problems i have to click twice on a youtube video to be played   after the first click the actual video shows up in a smaller region   for solid users sharing often categories are organized by priority tier or other purpose not what makes most sense for social sharing and assigning tags to a specific feed   this drives me crazy and feels like an invasion of privacy   is there any way to undo this   each time i use the chrome app it asks to connect to google reader   i press connect allow it and it doesn t load the feeds just returns to the same login page   i just reinstalled firefox on a new machine and i can t login to feedly via google authentication   it works fine with chrome ie but when i click the login link in firefox nothing happens   include outsidethenest net please   at work i received an alert from feedly that i needed to update to v of the plugin   when i get home i see that my home system is running v but i can t get to feedly com regardless of what i do because the plugin knows better than me   even after i log out of feedly   i have toy disable the extension   please make it possible to go to feedly com or make it possible to download an update from within the extension   hi i am not sure where i can claim problems   the feedly app is showing me an error since a couple of days   it is equal if i use my ipad or my iphone different provider sim cards both are showing me the error that no connection is there   after that i downloaded other feedly apps like ziner they work without any problem   what can i do   i wish to connect feedy with social networks youtube vimeo tumblr instagram to synchronize the news and our favorites   when can we command feedly through our voice   this will be an excellent advantage compared with other options   yes your are right too similar to her the movie   but i think it s necessary   come on guys twitter is winning the battle for far   i want feedly to be bigger   feedly mini is very nice plug in for me   but the feedly mini icon is not shown on the naver blog such as http panboy blog me or http blog naver com panboy   when you tap the pocket or instapaper icon there isn t much of a visual induction that the article has been saved   also would be nice to be able to send an article to pocket from the list view without having to open the article   swiping the title would be a good solution   when i open a feed within the internal browser and it does load the full webpage i d like to share it via email client having it imported as it is just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedly enabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so i can mail it out as it is or if you like as if i sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article   just as a reference under win using another feed reader feedly enabled and opening the mail app it does import the page so i can mail it out as it is or if you like as if i sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article   i am not sure if this is due to feedly app limitation or something else   but text only imports with just a link as i come up with with gmail app is poor   i started using a new chrome app called hacker vision   if flips the screen resolution so most webages have a dark back ground and fonts are light colors   it is supposed to be easier on your eyes   so far i m liking it but the colors are sometimes off   what i have noticed is that the feedly mini toolbar that pops up on the bottom right of web pages when i want to share the link via that mini feedly toolbar the background color and the color of the icons twitter buffer etc are all the same color   any way you can fix this   is this a problem that hacker vision needs to address   please advise   feedly is really bad at discovering feeds when given only the url   google reader used to be able to do this with pretty much every url you threw at it and it doesn t seem to be terribly complicated   giving this url to feedly returns no feeds   however if you manually google what the standard format for feeds is with wordpress and try out   which seems like something that feedly might have been able to guess to begin with   i had to turn off the windows tray app   chrome would gradually get slower and slower a new development since feedly asked to run the always on tray app   i m sure it s the app because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems   either fix it or make feedly work always on without browser interference   not much else to say include an icon for flipboard   integration with other social media so i can read all the latest tweets google updates and others from with the feedly app   you have a group of friends with send my favorite post writing command   currently some of the rss items are lists of links   expected behavior when i follow one of the links find it interesting and click the pocket icon is to save the clicked through article   instead it saves the initial rss item   take mike tyson s channel for example   that string ucdtnjowfqpgvk fyoelyzrg or any channel like that doesn t work with feedly   you have to go in and get the rss via https www youtube com rss channel string feed rss please automate this   i created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community don t remember how i got there and was very surprised never to get an answer until i realized you guys worked in user voice   there appears to be a current bug with the android app and the evernote integration   for about the last week when i try to save it forces me to re login to evernote   this is one of my primary use flows and a big bummer as i use two factor authentication on evernote   i noticed several of my facebook pages weren t updating and then saw this announcement that facebook has stopped updating rss feeds   the few that i follow are for ones where no website exists for them   i love feedly for following them please find a way   hey i have feedly notifier in firefox on windows   when i click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles i could open in new tabs   as it occurs on android and ios   i cannot for example highlight a friend when i m trying to tell something to him in my post   second why don t work with metro style on fb app   why this common and ridiculous traditional facebook style   why microsoft doesn t close this vacuum spaces this things it really needs   the rotation style of metro will be awesome   i remember in the beginning the fb works with this pattern and unfortunately you abandoned   when using internet explorer in windows phone on nokia lumia os i noticed that pointing to specific section of any document using #name doesn t work from pages using frameset doctype is correctly set to html supporting framesets   to verify try clicking on any method in java javadoc for example open http docs oracle com javase docs api and click through java applet appletcontext getapplet   java site uses brackets in links names which is not ok but this is not related to this issue and even links without brackets don t work   trial feature should be built in with auto prompted and disabling just like the windows store   if the user uninstalls during a trial if even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later   contract this with the windows phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc   if the user uninstalls and installs again later we have no idea   for an app that doesn t require a login so there s no account to tie the usage to and doesn t have a natural way to limit functionality adding a trial mode feels like implement and pray   with the two stores combining can we bring this to windows phone   contract this with the windows phone world where we tell you we want trial mode but we have to track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased more   you can only select text as big as screen   if larger it doesnt scroll down so you can only select part of the text   if ios and android can do it why can t windows phone   like all the timer apps on android ios they can update the badge numbers real time giving you a true countdown timer experience   why cant windows phone do this   it should be able to do this   would battery experience really degrade that much   if so me thinks this is a fundamental flaw in the os   is it possible to get a flash player for wp or silverlight for wp more and more websites doesn t work by video clips   there need to be a business app settings launcher native in the api   on my what s new panel in contacts i want to see posts from facebook from people that are subscribed followed and not for all friends   i have wp x   probably in wp x it s fixed   please give me info   the rss section does not seem to work when the app is installed   the phone can reach the xml file and it does work in the preview in the app studio   remove the lock screen and make it a notifications screen   want to add an image like radar cloud layer drone image etc to a phone map and have it scale relative to the zoom layer   our app requires to call a web service from the application deactivated application closing event to generate an analytics report   currently windows phone does not allow to call a webservice from these events   now that beta apps do not expire we the developers need a way to force remove a beta app from devices or remove access for certain users   please provide us a way via the dev center to force the expiration of the beta app for all or for certain users   when i turn off the setting screen autorotation i find that this function is still enable in the setting about phone   since many devs these days use consider only webkit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using ie which uses trident isn t much html compliant   it degrades browsing quality and i m unable to create a new browser which can fix this issue   uc browser and ie are already there but they use trident and are hopeless while browsing most of the websites that use vendor specific prefixes and non standard code   antutu results show and score only d graphics and the whole system as it is all d gets rendered really well and almost lag free   apart from these a game like asphalt has almost the same lag as minion rush does while those two are quite much different   from these i concluded that a big part of d rendering might be a burden upon cpu while gpu does not do much   is that right   add podcasts as new data resource in windows phone studio app website   there should be mechanism that code can read installed apps   change country on dev center account   cant believe this isnt possible   if you wont let me change the country at least let me close my account and recreate it   a simple component and plugin can be design to bring forth data to windows phone from our web pages rather on wordpress or joomla instead of using rss feeds   popular forums like kuenna for joomla and stand alone forums should be allowed   user and passwords sync should be allowed as well for participation   add coloured backgrounds   i d like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker   right now there s no easy way to automate their download and parsing   an http based api with a program friendly logon e g oauth would be most welcome   i love one note because of its fast cross platform sync i feel when i am on a call and want to take notes adding a button in the dialer loudspeaker mute hold add call to open onenote will help me open it easily   when it is opened from a call then onenote can get information on the call details person who is on call time etc which would enable easier understanding   similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of one note with other native applications like camera messaging etc   i want to be able to control the balance of the audio i play back with the backgroundaudioplayer   there is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it   allow microsoft phone scheduledtask   start at the specified time   facing problem while i open my app   it opens ad then close   the build in wp longlistselector will jump to the last item added when data loading   when used in combination with mvvm and sorted data this will result in the fact that the lls is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available   we now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded   please provide a property to enable disable this feature   in my application some data required to save on disk there is limited storage in phone memory i just need api to write or create files folder wise on external memory like memory card   add right to left orientation for text and pages support in windows phone studio app website   please allow us developers to access two dimensional array of bytes from the picture that is within the image control   this would provide much powerful photo apps for real time shutting and photo editing   i want to have access to all single bytes within picture so i can do with those bytes whatever i want   poder guardar aplicaciones en skydrive y poder ejecutarlas seria una funci n nica de los windows phone   ejecutarlas a pesar de no tener conexi n a una red   native video player and support for subtitle if i am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file srt   it would be real help in increasing user experience   it is a common scenario for the user to initiate a network transfer then turn off the screen or switch to another app while the transfer is still in progress   apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response   i m aware that the background transfer service is available but there are cases where this is not usable because it requires the data to be transferred to be written to temporary files in the storage   this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience   i completely understand the need for restrictions on background processing to help preserve battery life and responsiveness but windows phone is currently too restrictive   this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is more   it would be very useful to be able to prepair a mmscomposetask in the same way that we today could use the smscomposetask   being able to prepare an mms for the user would have many usages and the functionality are readily available on other platforms   it would be really good to add parallel linq in windows phone and portable class libraries for collection processing unification and efficiency   ssh ssl https and some other protocols for vpn tuneling whole device we need   the low end phone with less storage but with the sd are really diffused but the limit of the data that can t be stored in sd is awful   with the app on sd the device can be better   make ussd codes running on windows phone with os version   to use the search button for any application in order to avoir to add everytime a custom search functionality   when a phone is reset or replaced restoration o installed apps in quite cumbersome   the store lists purchase history but a re installation must be done one by one and b the list doesn t indicate which apps have been removed e g   would be cool to have an app or even better a command in the store app that saves a list of currently installed apps after each install uninstall so that the user can re install all the apps as easily as updating of a number of apps takes place now   after finishing the call it doesn t show the call history about how much time it we talked   in the dashboard when you are uploading images in the app description it does not work for me as i m sure there s a timeout implemented in the uploading code   i can upload the smaller promotional images fine but the larger sceenshot pngs will not upload   yes my internet upload speed is slow but the site should function for slow upload speeds also why not   the same goes for the app uploading itself a larger timeout is there but there is still a timeout that assumes a reasonably fast upload speed which not everyone has   everyone in the usa has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and i presume microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center   just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least its not a big deal to implement   everyone in the usa has more   the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options   week weeks weeks weeks up to weeks from a selected day   i hope you understand me   i m german and my english is not so good   my problem is i can use any calendar app but the function goes back to the base calendar   often i have to make dates that returns weeks on friday or two weeks on wednesday   in my old android calendar is it no problem but in my wp is it not possible   best regards and a happy new year karsten klein from germany the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options   best regards and a more   a shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like sso   invariably some users resort to posting negative reviews which actually are questions to the developer that the developer can not answer directly because of the way nature of the reviews   i would like to see a simple change to the rate and review page near the bottom   just add a small text blurb like if you are experiencing problems with this application please consider sending feedback instead along with a link to launch an email to the support email address   to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system   set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per user   to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support more   allow screen capture to be taken from background task or through mdm protocol   this is useful for techs using mdm systems for example if a user has an issue and calls their tech support they can request a screen capture and help them resolve   implement a free app of the week deal like apple does with ios   create a subclass of panel that allows absolutepositioning of it s children yet honours the layout bounds imposed by it s own

for search button on windows phone   we need override base keyboard with adding custom keys   and adding new text function add text from reading qr code   on the keyboard near the space button add new button input from camera   if you push this button start camera app and starting search qr code   full support for the applr earpods   it is nearly impossible to edit videos recorded by the phone on the isolated storage it shouldn t be this hard   one has to write its own libraries simply to encode and decode videos and access the frames let alone manipulate them and do something useful   even with native code support on wp it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this   i think it would be much easier to just provide apis for the hardware encoder decoder to edit videos on isolated storage and with better performance   a collegue of mine with an android smartphone has just showed me on this phone an android launcher called launcher https play google com store apps

pubcenter or bing ads performance on windows phone is very poor   indie developers need a better performing advertising team and ad control   can microsoft take advertising support seriously and provide world wide ad promotion and delivery   as it is indie developers have lost confidence in microsoft efforts in pubcentre bing ads and are moving to different ad controls and investing into android and ios platforms until microsoft starts to demonstrate that it is serious about providing revenue performant adversting services   we would like a wifi csp so we can configure users wifi this

avarage rating by country in the dev center report   sometimes reviews can be for previous versions of the app   this can lead to some confusion about complaints in the reviews and whether they were

services i would like to do the same using push notification like what is happening in ios   we can still have dm client and the dm client can react to push messages provided the device is enrolled   push notification free options like gcm google cloud message   it is imperative for certain apps that some form of persistent background connectivity be allowed   i appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power but if microsoft believes in putting the user in control then allow the user to enable access to persistent tcp connections on an app by app basis as windows allows   inefficient apps can then be disallowed by the user while still enabling experienced developers the flexibility to offer apps for legacy protocols that can t be converted to a push notification system among other

the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea   however if an it tech is using the same mdm vendor across all platforms the enrollment experience is then totally different   we would like to make the enrollment process consistent for our users   can we have an api to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download   the idea of background agents expiring if they have not been re initialized in two weeks makes sense   however in some scenarios they do not make sense   we have a company hub app that is downloaded after mdm enrollment this hub app uses a background task to post back some device info and location which is not available through the mdm protocol   there is no user interaction here so we would like to be able to set the expiry to never for our background tasks in this scenario   the only workaround just now is to keep track of when tasks were set up and send the user a toast to get them to click and activate the

what do you think   it would be good to know not only the number of downloads but also how many are active still   if you have seen the google store they show active installations more prominently

surprised cause there is no resourcedictionary template in add new ite dialog   though blend has this template   isn t it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according

images that are displayed in the vs list   an developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed   ideally this tool would show the developer all of the wp

instance in the message hub allow the user to scroll just by swiping the finger on it   the silverlight textbox doesn t support this kind of scrolling and forces the user to long tap on it until the

down unless it has pornographic or sexually explicit material which is not well defined in store policies   would it be too much to ask for an api that wraps whatever mechanism is required to accomplish this   a container for starting applications inside it on windows iot core instead of full screen   providing separate x and y factors would enable it to be used on objects without fixed aspect ratios   with separate x and y scale measurements both objects could be resized via pinch stretch   you can use wireshark to inspect packets and see that queries having a class of any will be answered by a dns sd registration from bonjour but will not be answered by the above dns sd registration   create an api that takes as an argument a command as a string   and using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say hey cortana my command but without voice interaction   it would be a huge advantage to support this attribute also on the app object in the app xaml file and to make this the ultimate root   allow license assignment for an application to be tied to azure ad group similar to how licenses in office can be managed   i want to create windows service which runs in background and checks if any bar code is scanned whenever a bar code is scanned i want the windows service to handle it and write the input to the text file   please make the fluent design toolkits available for affinity designer   would be great if setter had delay property to only execute it after a certain amount of time   it would be great to be able to get the current appointment and the next appointment a user has   add stopwatch controller   i want to add clock controller visually to show time   add printercontroller that was in wpf and winforms   is there anyway you could make windbg preview available for offline downloading   i would like to add bixby to this list   why don t build a phone powered by android but running customized by microsoft itself   also if cortana can read reply messages from the phone why not link that api or process not sure if those are the words needed for my idea to the messaging app that comes built in on w   and also it will be great the microsoft expands it services internationally like for example cortana which it barely works in regions outside the us   i hope that microsoft pay attention to this and do something because i would like to see them making its way in the mobile department   pd all microsoft apps should be native on the phone and you should also build up a mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app on windows   could you please increase the maximum size or better remove it at all   because of this i would like the functionality to only execute the selecteditem code when a row is doubletapped   my proposed solution is to add a rowdoubletapped event directly to the uwp datagrid class itself   i would like to add a animatedheaderedtextbox control to the toolkit   get back the offiline symbols download   would it be possible to enhance the loading control to disable navigation when it is running   most of the screen a wide so why not a horizontal layout for colorpicker   as a developer i want to see the screenshots and logs my customers are sending to me via the feedback hub   upon a person next logging into the device it would be nice to be able to have the app restart automatically too   i d like to see a way for any uwp app to opt in to being automatically restarted when the user logs in after a shutdown caused by an automatic reboot   having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause of the restart would be great for this too   it would allow the app developer to track why the app was restarted but more importantly it would allow for the app to provide a better experience that allows the user to continue where they last left off with the app running and at a specific position in the app   nav view should be made a full proof solution for developers   nav view should be more integrated to the application so that the app is consistent   this info should be mandatory imho   it would be great if i could have two webview each having a different user profile   a command like ms settings utilities would be very useful   for example an isselected property could be added to a treeviewnode or a function like selectnode treeviewnode to the treeview   so ever event handler must be like one touch behaver of user   i think microsoft should add a new property to fonticon that combines fontfamily and glyph into a single uri property call it glyphuri   further i think nuget should maintain a set of tags on all their properties one of these tags should be font icons so that when you click download new font its going to search nuget for this font icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular to least popular   also i think nugut should maintain user comments for each package and a star rating so that people can get an idea if the package is any good without installing   could you add the link for the feedback hub to the store s app review form   i believe that the app review and report for developers should be divided   is it possible to add the note to the review form as following   we need to open the window as maximized   please provide a way to configure the size of the window in the launchuriforresultsasync method   take sample from here https github com microsoft windows iotcore samples tree develop samples serialuart cs   run application and set breakpoint readasync method after line   if you are also using pinvoke kernel dll please install the nuget package directly to the uwp project automatic references added by other nuget packages like pclcrypto add an older version verify the version of pinvoke kernel dll in your bin x debug build output folder it should be at least   microsoft should give us the possibility to download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging   suggestion for pathicon datauri property for loading pathicon from a svg file instead of specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted to put this stuff f m l in their xaml   another possibility is to allow datauri to point to a text file holding this type of stuff f m l   would be nice if you could drag your file from the project tree over to a xaml property requiring an ms appx path and it would expand to an ms appx path instead of a fullpath to the file on your filesystem   this would be well placed in the task manager performance tab a dedicated usage graph could be displayed for ml activity   would be nice if you could set the height of a textbox using number of lines   and it can be made backwards compatible with height property in pixels   also heightlines should automatically set acceptsreturn property to true to make it super easy to create a multi line textbox in xaml   i also think there s something a little bit weirld about the textbox control if you specify lines height it should say lines in height and not expand box it should just beep when you get to the end of the lines of course it would be line if they built the scrollbars into the control then it would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the lines but i ll leave that for another complaint after they add a lineheight property to make it work the way people want it to work   the reason why its a good idea to add a heightline property is that it allows everything to be done in xaml setup the fontsize fontfamily and the pixels size automatically to expand to match exactly lines   from now onward please add sync methods first and optionally add supplementary async method for long operations   they are a welcome addition to the api but they should not be the only way to obtain data   it would be good to have an option in xbox device portal so that we can see the javascript console logs like network logs in http monitor tab   also it would be great if there is an option to inspect and debug   for example i can add some text or anything i please on the side instating how far is this point to the current gps location   in webview we can do panning by moving with fingers and zooming by pinching smooth and fluid   i think we should take it one step further and make notepad opensource like powershell so the open source community can continue to add features to notepad to become the go to text editor for performing quick edits of programming   it would be useful for notepad to update from being a win app to a uwp one   in keeping with current ms strategy of bringing cross platform apps to the windows store making notepad one of these would be extremely helpful   it would be convenient to have a selectedbackground property for calendarview   please check these links where users discussed similar issue   inputpane should not be opened and closed again and again for each input element   there should be option of preventing auto hiding when getting focus through tab button of inputpane just like preventkeyboarddisplayonprogrammaticfocus which is also not working in uwp target version   enable d application developers to easily use d volumetric content in xaml composition by configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations   add a panel that allows to create a design with constraints and support in blend   i would like the ability to filter the call stack when trying to trace a function call   essentially make it as searchable as the solution explorer with the ability to add some exclusion rules   bring webview with edge to wpf and winforms applications   and now that i am in my s iam still playing and building but my mother and her friends cant keep up with windows they are having a hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate   now that windows has lte support rcs messaging api should be introduced so we can take advantage of this messaging protocol in our uwp apps   attach devices to another and ensure it full loading   hot unplug and wait about s   now my idea all controls could have a default property for localization   an attribute could be used to identify the default localization property for a xaml control   it might be placed in a menuflyout in a button in a appbarbutton   maybe at least if using the simplified folddown mode panning other file formats could be supported   in webb for hololens running apps section should have a column that tell the user account under which a app process is running   i would like to ask microsoft developers to fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees of freedom going through the rdc   i think we can support this by adding a simple constructor that takes in the same parameters as initialize   add loginhint as optional param to loginasync and plumb through getusertokenv async   so it would be great to have access to this values to stay on track with actual developments from other vendors   introduce functionality so that mac address can be obtained programmatically   another possiblity is to add an attribute to button called   if custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark s associated with them   since we are passing a string via the x bind attribute to some ui controls it would be nice if we could make the binding to a readonlyspan t so we avoid allocations   you could rename the windows mobile to windows watch and you could stop making the lumia mobile phones but you could start making lumia smartwatch with windows watch   it needs to work as good as the one available in winmm dll   please add a semi automated test queue mode to driver verifier where you can select a group of drivers and then have driver verifier test them one at a time moving down the queue one position with each reset or reboot   an automated test queue would be wonderful in a situation like this   please look into how musicians and developers use midi and what we would like to be able to do with devices like the surface and prioritize giving us the ability to innovate here   the swipecontrol control should support mouse input as well as touch input   i personally would like to be able to have a similar arrangement in my own apps but currently am unable to do so   resize the windows explorer window to something like px to px   to fix it just resize the window to a bigger proportion of the screen when is not fullscreen and then maximize it again   add an option to let user do so   it might make sense to have that option in task manager since it is the tool to control startup tasks in windows   adding an image editor to captureelement control with these options ability to save captured image as predefined image types jpg png etc   how about an option to automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts   add store uri schema like ms windows store assoc appext q to search app extensions   it would be useful if this feature can be supported in windows   i want the screen setting to be an option where i can set my preferance as a default   it d be great if we could chain functions together in x bind to create more complex expressions   rather than writing a specific function for this purpose it d be nice if it could be composed of individual pieces that can be combined in many more ways   it would be good if we could submit utility tools to the store as there is no way to perform these tasks without admin   maybe warn the user when downloading the app or more stringent verification process for these apps but don t block them completely as you re hurting both devs and users   with the publisher in the manifest locked to the developer name as well this should be implemented to make uwp apps much easier to distribute outside of the store   please improve the app submission process for internal beta testing   provide a lock to the tiles so that the tiles won t get collapsed accidentally   button to right click and left click in the touchpad of continuum control display in mobile will be very helpful   i have more than apps in the store and would like to see all downloads of these apps as a number   but i hope my suggestion will be passed to where it can be the most helpful   the first feature i wanted to suggest is that i believe cortana is lacking certain capabilities on apple ios specifically the ability for cortana to send emails from the cortana app directly by outlook for iphone   similar to how cortana handles text messages it would be nice if cortana could draft an email onto outlook for the iphone   the second insight i would like to provide for feedback is on the cortana s speech recognition on apple ios and android and user input   however i would still appreciate being able to see a text message notification i have received on my iphone from cortana   vr is not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too   suggestion if the returned storagefile class could not provide the actual entry of the choices selected by the user maybe the filesavepicker could do it with a read only property or method after the user confirmed the file   m could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it s just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users   the could start with small things like this feedback form which is annoying too   trysetwallpaperimageasync only supports a primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper to be set for any attached displays   add a switch statement for xaml which allows app developers to modify parts of a layout based on a value   i would like to add the functionality myself or contribut if somebody could help me   i think ms needs to provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using windows s   i d like a user voice where we can request certain software be added to the windows store   i d like students to be able to install scratch and sketchup for example   but it would be good for ms to approach in reverse based on school feedback   update apps same time as ios and android updates theirs   include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers   please set some heat sensing app by default in your windows before it is too late   set a multi alarm software so that it can cope coming world situations   let us make a different type of os which can understand and not only communicates with the user   it would be extremely helpful if we could create a custom dictionary word list constraint as we can already with speech recognition as it was possible in the old microsoft ink api   please add windows update to default rules   please un hamstring windows and support process isolation for containers   please allow that api in in background   microsoft should re enable the windows bridge for android   get public tweets without user s authentication   take any xaml page add a button to it and bind it to any normal as in not a command on the view model   compile the app and the xaml compiler throws the exception   with proper hooks many different scenario variations could be achieved   let s say there is a app which display news stories   in my opinion developers should not have to do this to prevent multiple unintended events from a control   we need a fix to ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after it has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code to each and every async handler   closing the streamsocket by disposing deleting it should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads or writes   it would be nice it there was an api discovery endpoint   adding visibility property on expander and making the header invisible will make the panel looks like it is sliding into the view   allowing uwp access packaged com will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow re use much more traditional win apps   hi you really need to fix the xbox app store   at the very least publishing on xbox should be an opt in function when publishing not an opt out one   it would be nice if you also ported the ads into uwp apis so that they can be used with desktop bridge apps   please add wmi support on uwp   these apis ought to be allowed for any uwp application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation   i d like to see an api to create virtual midi ports built into windows   the surface touch screen has tons of possibilities as a midi controller but this currently requires installing a rd party driver which is not a great end user experience   built in rtpmidi would be nice too but at least this would be achievable without a kernel mode driver if we had virtual midi ports   allow uwp applications to tick a box in the appxmanifest declaring it as a full trust desktop application   prevent full trust apps from targeting phone and xbox if you have to   if it s an issue virtualize the registry as with the desktop bridge   look the concept of uwp apps can run on your phone rip and your xbox while admirable isn t practical for most applications   show a notice to users upon install more   it would be nice to have an attached property for scrollviewer to set middle click scrolling   code would be useful in adapting to bluetooth applications   check the create date on the file   wait one minute so the clock shows a new minute and the run the code again   if you go into the explorer and delete the file and create it in explorer with the same name the create date is correct   following the comments on the blog post for af unix it would be nice to see sock seqpacket and or sock dgram support   i would like to vote to have this feature be configurable in settings allowing users to disable this feature   please add support for cryptuiwiz api to handle timestamp reply   can t the reason of revocation of extended execution be a little more specific than systempolicy applicationclosing applicationsuspended   in uwp project follow xaml code make a win exception when minimum target is build   allow copy paste in settings pages for path instructions and especially in failure error outcomes for self repair fix research lookups   it is possible to disable suggestions in the settings but i guess apps should be able to disable this themselves   will be possible to share the roadmap on the lcow improvment   grouping another optional feature to enable grouping on basis of a string property of the items   search bar a top search bar attached to the control which can be enabled disabled with a boolean property   one of the problems in here is unity code which is mostly made to be single instance but it would be great to have support to launch multiple instances of the same app   i d like to add itemclick event to the carousel control to be able to use it as item listing control with the ability to click on items like in the gridview and listview   so please remove this restriction   if this is a privacy constraint then please consider to add a capability that can be declared in the app manifest   based on this it also could notify the user at first app start like it is done with the camera access   markdowntextclock should provide linkcommand alongside linkclicked event   it would be good if textboxregex will be automatically delete letters at input like the textboxmask   maybe a new validationmode type would make sense here   can you add the d viewer object that is used by paint d and mixed reality viewer   include the mouse and keyboard support   make it available for net wpf also and via nuget   please add an overload to create a mediastreamsample from a d d surface   but it would be even better if we could configure the compiler somehow through a special screen in the properties or through an optional configuration file   in such a configuration we could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example twoway for textbox textproperty   get rid of the emailmessage body character limit   if you have such limits publish them in the api docs   the aforementioned forum post suggests using a remote api as a work around   please give developers the option to not participate in the upcoming sets feature   recommendation contentdialog should do the locking so that the user does not have to   to have a dialog that can be used at any time and that always shows centered on the main window of the app you must have two copies of the dialog one embedded in xaml and shown using inplace but only if it is loaded and the other not embedded in xaml and shown using popup   recommendation add a parameter to showasync that positions the dialog relative to the main window of the app centered left right bottom   since only one contentdialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as semaphoreslim or a sequential queue of taskcompletionsource   but it would be nice to choose what elements get discarded first in case there s isn t enough space on the tile   when declaring a custom template for contentdialog the template root must contain a border with x name container otherwise the showasync method will throw a system accessviolationexception   so i propose a download archive for windows insider preview sdks where we can download earlier versions of the preview sdks   the expected behaviour is that when you click on the primary or secondary button in a contentdialog then focus should be switched to the button concerned otherwise x bind bindings wont update   please make registration posible for moldova   please extend keyframeanimations scalarkeyframeanimations to makte them pausable and resumable   in mediacomposition add transitions between two clips on timeline e g   i think it s good if rotatortile has an indicator which shows what index is selected or maybe another control that can be attached to rotatortile   the panorama mode is beautiful and if only we could have a button to call the api from inside our apps it would be great   that s why i m suggesting a specialized textbox for numbers   allow entering negative values   allow entering decimal values   format the text with a specific number of decimal place i e   i m suggesting a textbox with the following feature   it should return dom element and coordinates and in case of image also the raw bytes   at least receiving scriptnotify events should be possible on http and without adding applicationcontenturirules in manifest so that we could atleast have a way to do it on our own   switch the default to lf style line endings in the whole operating system   there are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using navigationview   please provide this same information on the usage page   it would be nice to be able to specify an itemssource and automatically populate it with mvvm   in short we need a uwp alternative to showcaseview https github com amlcurran showcaseview   there should be a machine learning sdk smilar to apple coreml   uwp should include a augmented reality sdk simlar to apple arkit and google ar dev kit   could you add this to the list of uwp apis supported in desktop bridge   i really need to be able to programmatically restart my app   please fix it to support hiding pivotitems correctly especially during data binding when you can t simply add remove it from the items collection   please make esent jet blue technology open source and available on net core and xamarin for operating systems other than windows   new control to add multiples tags with close button and auto suggestion functionality   please add allaccountsreadwrite to userdataaccountstoreaccesstype in order to allow to creates calendars on remote calendar providers   provide funtionality similar to currentappsimulator class found in windows applicationmodel store namespace   another solution could be simply extend office store in order to publish vsto add in   please add reveal effect on each item on the listview in the hamburger menu control as per creators fall update   the possibility to make optional packages plugins with code for in process with c# and or vb net instead of c   when i make store listings for several languages i would like to be able to just right click on a listing then copy it and edit not be troubled with details on cvs and excell   also would like to see when exactly a listing was updated   please add to uwp ble api methods to interrogate ble stack connection settings   you may wish to consider my flippdfviewercontrol for inclusion in the toolkit   it would be good to see support for setting a gridview inside a listview which has the ability to add columns   so your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path string   what would be helpful is to have a service in the toolkit to get an azure ad token   having access to the visibility of the system back button is good but there are some scenario s where i think it would make sense to have a disabled state for this button which could be toggled by dev s in certain scenarios   it would be nice to have a way to automate update upgrade bash ubuntu on windows that does not require to start bash   you should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for cr or business card and pos receipt paper wasn t stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved   please allow generic classes to be base classes of xaml pages controls   obviously i would expect in point that neighboring files should still be available but maybe slightly slower   allow winappdriver to switch context from native to webview   imagine writing text directly into the textbox or richeditbox canvas without the ink keyboard overlay   by the way speech recognition should be handled the same way   so come on all the apis are already there give windows ink a boost   would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay   please make sure the p invoke either points to a windows api allowed in uwp applications or a native dll that is part of the package   if for some reason your p invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use dllimport exactspelling true to indicate that you understand the implications more   move from onedrive sdk to microsoft graph   add msal support for v auth model   could this not also be provided in the uwp toolkit for inclusion in uwp apps   add a custom calendarview control with more personalization options than the one included in the sdk   individual calendarmonthview control so that if you want to display standalone months you can maybe you display a grid of months etc   i think in first case must be fired buttonpressed event too like it happens on phone call   it would be very useful to be able to immediately release the memory held by a uwp bitmapimage which can be significant for large images   please make it possible to locate at the other three corners   we need backward compatibility for xaml just like android for example we can just use navigationview without any conditional check at all   please add support for composition visual to handle pointer interactions   it would be nice to have a uwp or xamarin community tutorial where devs can contribute to the tutorial and make it up to date   create a cordova plugin to enable ios and android hybrid apps to use project rome features   i would really like to switch to uwp for development however i m not able to elevate users to install a uwp app that win apps wouldn t have any problem just downloading from a network drive   and also in full screen i would expect transport controls to ignore safe area   could microsoft not add a padding reflecting the core window bounds to the full screen window only instead of manipulating a grid by name   i want the transport controls semi transparent area more   add tumblr service too   we could also be able to start tracking packages directly too   consider a full screen application where you d like to temporarily control that brightness   please extend the api to run on desktop and mobile devices not in embedded mode   it would be better if it was as fast as the webclient class used in a desktop application   both problems could be solved by adding groupstyle itemtemplate   and virtualization could be optimized as well by using container cache per group   imagine a image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images   folders must of course use a very different item template than images   i want to see a better windows store first where my apps can be found   please give the highest priority to improve app discoverability in windows store   apps must be found by keywords   it would make sense that the app be published to the private store and users who have not been allocated a license should have the ability to request a license rather than just getting an error message   for events the target method must not be overloaded   add a control that reminds users to rate your uwp app after a certain amount of time or app launches   depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads in the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity to make them soft   set depth writes enabled or disabled set other state changes make the draw call   in my opinion the d d dsv read only depth is really useless and should be removed any state validation for reading and writing to the depth texture should just check for d d depth stencil desc depthwritemask in each draw call   however to don t sacrifice performance those validation checks should be performed only in debug mode d d setexceptionmode d d raise flag driver internal error and in that case the draw call should still be allowed but it only should issue a debug warning writing to depth and reading from it in the shader may produce undefined results   you should trust the application to let it manage the correct state changes on its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance   this would result in smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead power usage longer battery life   you will don t have to do these checks if this artificial requirement is removed from dx api   add ability to conditionally trigger a keyframe animation from an expression animation in order to support more complex animation scenarios   cam on we need a service status page with we have issue we re working on   we already have the pulltorefreshlistview in the toolkit so we can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name to something more suitable like listviewex and have both of the functionality in a single control   please make the control usable in an app   make a menu with information about the files being locked by an application   it would save a tons of space to only have one small svg for a simple icon rather than a dozen large png files   add eyedropper ability to pick color outside of the uwp app   there should be a form developers can fill out to request expedited review   it would be useful if this limitation were removed allowing physical web support to be developed using windows alone without requiring additional hardware resources to publish beacons   can we please improve the situation by adding missing api   for my work app we wanted the app to launch maximised   the closet option is to launch it fullscreen but that obscures the task bar   allow app to launch uri with http schema in default video or audio player not only store player win apps support will be great   what would be really helpful is to provide an event maybe something like directmanipulationcompleting that would fire as soon as the pointer is released e g   allow to register background tasks to be registered when die app is first installed from store or side loaded without having the need to start the app first   we need something like an installationtask   allow their to be faster response times for contacting app store after submitting feedback link found at the bottom of the certification report after having your app rejected   in japanese input the font style should be applied to the left character   it d be great if the slider control could have a tickoffset property to make the tick marks not start at the left most edge of the control   it would be nice to be able to easily create rounded or circular buttons in uwp without creating custom control template   allow us to withdrawal the money because we don t know when we can reach the threshold usd   this can be really helpful if you want to easily create a multi lingual cortana experience if you use resw   so we hope that uwp image control and imagesource can support more and more pixelformat like as wpf net framework   example page app should be configured to use dark theme   to recreate paste the below xaml into a blank page and run be sure the app is configured to use dark theme   accessing this information through an api would be useful for creating automated kpi reports   as a windows developer i would like the site to be improved to give a reasonable performance   create new user control with ability to selecte date and time something similar to https wpftoolkit codeplex com wikipage title datetimepicker referringtitle home in wpftoolkit   please add headeredcontentcontrol to the community toolkit   would like to see the possibility to add a search bar to the master details view that filters results in the master pane   download getpercentage to get the download compleated percentage so that it can be used for creating progessbar   should support background download   allow the webview to display uri from the application s local folder   raise single events but it s bad for performance   raise reset event   e newitems but simple pick the first one   so please allow uwp apps without net native   i wish the interstitialad will have built in animation at least a fade in effect when it shows   a better option would be to add a new role option for the accounts to indicate which accounts can raise support issues   it just needs the context command that returns the current context name which could be hard coded as native app   it would be nice if the driver returns correct size and position so that i don t have to guess and click through the tree to find an element   user should be able to style the carousel items like we do for listviewitems listboxitems   user should be able to write style for all the viewstate like focused selected unselected normal etc   we need a way to save documents generated and populated within our apps to pdf or xps   it would be nice if there were an option somewhere where you could reboot your system straight into the bios menu   please can someone implement this line of code and let me know if if is already working   add shadow option to xaml ui elements   please add bthproco l cap to allow us to use a lower implementation   could you add support of xamarin forms to the project rome sdk   so please before you completely remove suppresssystemoverlays make sure there s a way for us to force the status bar on and off even when we have entered full screen mode   with suppresssystemoverlays you can still force the status bar to show using statusbar showasync   please provide with more information or planschedule   release the sharedusercertificates for individual developers   trigger animation based on scroll position or percentage while we scroll pan in uwp c# like many web ui component as superscrollrama js   since something like this would pretty much be aligned with the whole motion theme of the fluent design system i think it would be great if you could support it in future builds so we could use it with other composition apis to add new visual details and effects to our apps that are not possible at the moment   bring rip silverlight deepzoom control to uwp control and pivotviewer too with win d capabilities   my suggestion idea is to reduce the development time effort needed for asp net web application   typical problem here would be deployment installationupdate of the ui application to client machine but if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the ui app should be only one obfuscated executable file it should not depend on reference libraries   this ui should get loaded on client machine as the user types in url in windows task bar which has the search boxthus removing the dependency on browser for web applications   the downloaded application should not be taking much space on user machine and it should not require installation and it should not require user to double click open but it should open as the user types the url in the search box in task bar   this ui application should have pure ui logic with all xaml files instead of html to support running on all devices and all os linuxwindows onwards   it seems storagefolder createfolder does not support multi segment path   windows system remotesystems remotesystem does not provide meaningful data for xbox   and checking getcapabilitysupportedasync is always false for any known capability   when adding a statusfilter for available xbox is never shown   this makes it very hard to know upfront if the user can actually launch an uri on xbox because it s totally unclear whether xbox is currently running or applications are allowed to run remotely   nevertheless if xbox is running and i use the remotelauncher the app is at least started correctly   the state is always unknown when the watcher triggers added or updated event   using send to compressed zip folder with files gb outputs non iso conforming files which results in errors in many unzip

release   windows store policy for adult content   microsoft support working for report app are taking down apps which have partial but no nudity   game of thrones is on the windows store and contains full frontal nudity and graphic scenes so it is quite ridiculous when apps are removed that have partial nudity or body parts blurred out or covered   windows store policy for adult content   partial nudity is not pornographic nor sexually explicit   note that a windows forms implementation probably won t work because of deep seated incompatibilities in the windows forms architecture   a wpf only solution is enough for me however   it is currently officially impossible to display the acrylic window background effect in a non uwp window   several developers have managed to coax out the private api used to implement this feature in a desktop app see https withinrafael com adding acrylic blur to your windows apps redstone desktop apps however this api is officially unsupported can change at any time and has been changed in a backwards incompatible manner once in the past   with the new windows ui library now in pre release   are there plans to ensure new controls will be listed in the toolbox alongside the os based standard controls   will dragging from the toolbox automatically add the using markup to the page   will the blend features like isolated template editing be working   consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the ui toolkit iterates in the future   will the compact mode resource dictionary be bundled with the nuget package so it can be referenced in the app resources without having to ask developers to copy and paste xaml files   currently the manipulationdelta event args provides a single scale factor for pinch stretch

have built an app that targets windows and the customer is looking for a servicing fix on windows   i have got the fix ready but in order to produce a fix i need to be able to compile with the microsoft advertising sdk for windows xaml   is there anywhere i can find a copy and download it   i have included code to reproduce the issue   the issue seems to be somewhere in windows ui xaml dll textblockviewhelpers adjustpositionbycharactercount   it appears that garbage data from the stack i assume is being used for the value curinlinelength   call stack https hastebin com legulilabu   is not news that window mobile won t have a chance against the major oss out in the market so i was thinking why try to implement something new when what is out there can be used for good on microsoft side   so this i have been thinking so far   microsoft have a good amount of apps on the google play store   they have a great launcher cortana outlook office for mobile and so on   how many consumers runs w on their pcs or laptops   the applicationviewmode compactoverlay also known as picture in picture mini mode or always on top for uwp apps has a maximum window size which seems to be a square with sides of approximately half screen height   unfortunately i can not since this is limited through windows   is there a good reason for this somehow arbitrary limit   it s mini mode has exactly the same limitation   other than our product manager said pixels are a good maximum width and height for something called compact   previously it was possible to add an eventsetter to the datagridrows style as mentioned here https stackoverflow com questions wpf datagrid row double click event programmatically but since eventsetter is now not apart of uwp i am left without this functionality   this already exists with the listview class which has a similar itemclicked event as an alternative to selectionchanged   this can become inefficient and somewhat confusing when users are able to select more than one items   this is helpful for layout debugging   suppose windows is misbehaving   suppose i want this to happen under program control   suppose i want it to be absolutely certain the video has not been monkeyed with   i can add only a style behavior or create a custom control for it   what do you prefer   could someone answer my question please   the windows bridge does not create a correct output files   i disabled the av the result is unsucceesful   what would i do   it looks like the bridge cannot remove its own folder while cleaning up the environment   i made a uwp app with a listview using keeplastiteminview   on many systems probably the slower ones the scrolling behavior is very odd   using the touchpad mousewheel the scrollbar starts moving but not the contents of the listview   i need to drag the scrollbar using the mouse to go the bottom top of the listview   this behavior is not consistent   on other systems is works as expected   so they get stuck in all the networks devices cache and never go away   i have found other reports of people around the internet who have struggled with the same bug e g   i filed one against a microsoft example on github here   i am using microsoft s dns sd which aims to implement the zeroconf standard rfc https tools ietf org html rfc   i got nearly everything working except the case of finding all service types on the network using the service type services dns sd udp on the local domain   this is really useful for making debugging tools such as making a service discovery browser   i get no results when i try plugging services dns sd udp   you can see this for the summary on this feature here or in the rfc   for comparison i ve tested this on bonjour avahi and android s network service discovery and they all handle this case correctly   first is there any way to get this to work   i m using the microsoft example found here   find all service types does not work   for comparison i ve more   that was a very good build   template has a loading busy page that has this functionality   the existing color picker have a very long height   i know this will be simple just edit the style but i can t make it right   when dropping appx bundles onto the drop target the page takes a long time to respond   because the page doesn t change to reflect the drop operation was successful i inadvertently drop multiple packages onto the target wasting my time and bandwidth   as a developer i m always in the dev dashboard   despite being built to appear as a single page app clicking pretty much any link in dev dashboard will result in an entire reload of the page to include navigation bars and columns   this behavior makes quick health checks and submissions nearly impossible   i now avoid logging in until absolutely required   i can t delete or hide them in the dashboard   this eats up screen real estate and impacts load times   i contacted support and they can t delete them either srx id   as a developer that has to stay on top of feedback i receive feedback from users around the world   i cannot delete this feedback   this clutters up my feedback interface and impacts load times   i contacted support and they can t delete it either srx id   as a developer i manage customer groups for package flighting and customer segmentation   when i m done using a customer group i cannot delete or hide it   unused groups eat up screen estate and impact load time of the page   as a developer i create submissions for my apps   in the age ratings area i m told my current rating id is c c b be e dd f e   i don t know what that means   i hope it s right   this screws up my group metrics e g count and makes it annoying when sending out email blasts commercial providers use recipients as a metric for billing   when i click a customer group to manage it opens in a new window unlike most of the other links in the dashboard   this may seem minor but it s a huge irritant   death by a thousand cuts   this data is critical to resolving customer issues   note you cannot see files images attached to the item   bonus you can t delete this feedback   when a machine automatically reboots as part of installing updates any running apps are closed   a small number of non uwp desktop apps do this but rely on service components to trigger restarting the app which is undesirable in a modern uwp environment   i m aware that there s some potential overlap here with proposed timeline and sets functionality which allows people to continue where they left off but this request is specifically focused on what happens when the pc restarts without interaction when the user is away from the device   this violates developer expectations   since the semanticzoom is subscribed to the backrequested event if i navigate to another page and press the back button the backrequested event is not called on my navigated page since it is handled by the semanticzoom in the previous page even if page caching is disabled for the frame   everytime i open a uwp app both xpadder and the app recognize input thus doubling the signal   even the hamburger button does not work properly when using extended view and collapsed back button   the hamburger button is on the side of the back button   up to date with win pro build rs insider slow ring and no corresponding desktop app converter base

sometimes i can t find it at all   take spotify for instance https www microsoft com store apps ncbcszsjrsb   all i find is initial release date   i want to know what date it was updates what version number it currently has and weather the developer provided a changelog   i have a scenario when my user wants to sign into two different accounts   it logs off account when logging into account   api uses a webview based auth   there are a lot of ms settings commands to launch different settings pages from code on hololens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings   our primary uwp app is currently compiled as x only because there are some limitations of c libs we use   we ve discovered just today that webgl does not work in webview in uwp apps compiled as x on windows   when using menyflyout showat frameworkelement point with menuflyoutpresenter style with rounded corners or other semitransparency unwanted white background is shown under it in windows   this was not happening before on windows or earlier   our app is using menuflyout with shadow effect a lot so it s causing us lot of headache right now   mouse sensors and other similar harware

glyphuri in the vs xaml editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a fonticon wizard   when you select either on it automtically adds the font to a folder under your project called

user tapping x button on sets window https i imgur com wziitq png the event not raised correctly   because a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the microsoft store   the launchuriforresultsasync method works fine   but we can t change the size of the window that is opened   this prevents us from using this api   when running a uwp app on win desktop i m able to add two timedtextcues to a timedmetadatatrack with the same starttime but on mobile it results in a crash   i m guessing this is a bug because it doesn t produce an understandable exception   if i add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediasource externaltimedmetadatatracks the crash happens when adding the track   i reproduced this on mobile emulator wxga inch gb and on a lumia running   comment lines from to where serial device settins read   connect to port and try to send data to it   you will see that await loadasynctask never ends   the last three days i was working hard to solve a problem submitting our uwp app to the store   now i know why it was not working and i want to make my knowledge public   we have an uwp app targeting windows fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously   a new version fails the certification process with app crash or freeze   side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines   this package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain   but the appxbundle package extracted from the appxupload this is the zip file uploaded to the store fails at startup after it was side loaded on my test machine   for side loading you need to install the cer file contained in the apppackages appname version test folder to your system cert store unter trusted roots ok something must be wrong with the uploaded appxupload package   this package does always crash after side loading it   so this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process   now things are very complicated   the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup   unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process   also microsoft support could not help me   they build a package which fails without details and i can not download the build package for debugging   fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process   so i was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging   using some gflags and vs i was able to find that the entry point for formatmessage was not found   the problem here was that for some vs releases the c program files x windows kits app certification kit supportedapis x   xml file contains some entry point definitions for formatmessage which does not exist   so the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup   but why was it working on my local machine   this is because i am using visual studio which has already fixed the problem   unfortunately the build infrastructure of microsoft which is used for the uwp certification process at least for our targeted os version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the supportedapis x   after i used the latest version of pinvoke kernel dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine   local release builds created with the native toolchain of vs are working   here the supportedapis x   xml for their build environment   i hope this helps   maybe it will help someone   debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine   side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test more   after a trial has expired the expiration date is set to   previously this is messy because it requires setting from c# code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code   my approach is xaml and doesn t require messy calculations   when heightline then the height is calculated using heightline property   let s say i have a couple of views and their related viewmodels   several members of returned json from twitter s api are missing from the services twitter implementation   the

not unified across different controls   however we can t do the same thing in map control or in photos app   it acts just like using a mousewheel with increment and it makes us feel awful

selected   i experienced problem with uwp listview particularly using isupportincrementalloading interface as a datasource   a few words about problem context   in our uwp app there is a listview and it uses isupportincrementalloading as a datasource   and while next part of data is loading listview is disabled   so the problem in that if you scroll listview in way you catch scrollbar and pull it to the down   when you scroll to the end of the list listview will be disabled for some period of time while data is loading   and if you release mouse button from scrollbar   you cannot hover mouse on scrollbar because when try to do it scrollbar goes upper   note i ve got success with experiencing this problem in uwp app created from scratch used listview and isupportincrementalloading   note if discard of using isupportincrementalloading   the problem exists but a bit another kind of   thanks in advance   unable to prevent auto close of inputpane which is creating issue due to a possible

currently enrolled to receive the fastest windows inside builds   i currently use cortana each day on windows android and iphone   i have noticed that sometimes the microphone function on the iphone and android app tends to stall or freeze   it doesn t matter if i set the microphone to open upon application launch or activate the microphone the delay in time the user has to wait to speak to cortana is quite noticeable   i understand the limitations of apple so it s unlikely the user will be able to respond to a text message directly on a windows pc   for example when i want to go to my

use to fix a memory leak   that just turns my memory leak issue into a hard drive bloat issue   thanks for nothing microsoft   poolmon is not offered as a standalone tool and only as part of the

requesting to ms directly   machines now have the power to really make lisp shine and show all it can do to empower uwp developers to create amazing solutions   what s the reason that currently microsoft is blocking a price increase   we tried to embrace microsoft s vision for uwp but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money   we built a uwp application that reads public data off iso smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode   in debug mode it all works fine   in release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification   the smartcard functionality however which is based on a net standard library fails to work https github com danm de pcsc sharp   we are now trying to use the native uwp smartcard api but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit apdu which are the basic communication block   hope this issue lands in the priority list of microsoft   for now we have no option but to re build the app to a non microsoft environment   the wireless card worked well till windows   now this is a mess   intel says they cannot give update   i have to do it whenever there is some heavy

allow it to access additional com objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above   we are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated xbox apps   it used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high   now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on xbox and by default every windows app that is published is published on all devices   it is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem   one simple example is there is a pdf database app on the new apps list on xbox   you cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on xbox one   yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section   it is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it   i know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device more   currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases

 but there s no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded   please fix this annoying issue   uwp is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and wpf is like a third class citizen with microsoft in the background cheering upgrade to uwp   the sandbox nonsense has to go   of the applications they install aren t and won t be   sandboxed uwp

top level windows that are already available   i have a disk imaging which i have already converted application that writes bytes directly to disk usb and sd cards   the app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required   so in a round about way you re actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead   current clipboard api can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine   but getting or setting the content doesn t work if the app is in background or unfocused   if this is a privacy constraint then more   currently the input will be validated if the focus of the textbox lost   it is possible for us to get a d ddevice from mediastreamsource as

kinda like uservoice but for bug reports   i have an app that works normally but when launched via the desktop bridge there s some strange issues with com   what does the desktop bridge do differently   coreapplication now has a requestrestartasync method but it fails in a desktop bridge app with notinforeground   any ideas on how i can cause the app to restart   however collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the ui visual tree   since you can correctly hide listboxitems i m considering this a bug   repeatedly calling mediaplayer stepforwardoneframe mediaplayer stepbackoneframe should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back   at first this isn t an issue since the control isn t visible   however if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear   this was probably done as a performance optimization however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won t bind when an item is not visible in the ui   otherwise yet again mvvm is broken   i have a uwp usercontrol line chart that renders a pathfigure to a canvas   at high zoom levels above the entire uwp app will crash with a native exception an unhandled win exception occured in app   this crash only happens using the fall creators update after the clipping issue was fixed   i m guessing it s a numerical

store   an idea could be extending desktop app converter tool in order to manage vsto add in   i reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties   however when using the result in a drag drop or clipboard operation windows explorer errors out with x no such interface supported   it can be used between uwp apps but not in windows explorer which really is a shame   there are desktop win apis for delay creation of files that are used heavily e g   in winzip and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in uwp   things like minconnectioninterval maxconnectioninterval slavelatency and connection supervisory timeout   it is a compendium of various pdf viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control   this of course can already be found in wpf any for any developers who want to migrate their classic desktop app to uwp this would be a big boost   so at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folder picker and navigate from the pictures library to the path d very long path final folder   actual implementing an selection of file or folder in uwp how easy but stupid   so picker suggestedstartlocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries   now after the great windows fall creators update it is still a joke to switch and develop to uwp   does anybody at ms have an idea how to propose an path in an uwp application   under uwp it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox   and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder   so this is now in after the great fall creators update still a ridiculous status of the great iniative change to more   we ll currently i have a uwp app that needs to call a web api service that is secured with azure ad   i have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and i have found some   but they all differ in what to do exactly   for example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes   am even stock now i would be glad if you can update it now   i need a similar feature for uwp   there are several issues with the file activation neighboringfilesquery argument and the file system indexer   if files are loaded using the neighboringfilesquery then getpropertiesasync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed   this prevents reading things like altitude from the gps location data   the above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for ssd drives   in particular no imageproperties are available in this case   if the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my pc so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo   i don t think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable   when setting tooltipservice placement to mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp   it looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically   this is on windows fall creators update build dpi scale the app targets windows sdk   example open the mail app write the mail content with the pen directly on the richeditbox canvas text gets recognised boom done   the way ink input is currently handled is sooo win i know there is inkcanvas and windows ui input inking analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard more   currently in masterview we can only use listview   it limits the use case of masterview   we can t use pivot semantic zoom gridview pulltorefresh slidablelistitem and more   then devs can use connected animations   i upgraded to the latest vs and change my uwp app to use net native   it now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by microsoft components   i don t call this function   when i traced down some new crashes i found that socket connectasync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn t exist   i have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things i don t directly call   i ve reverted to net native until this gets fixed   calling this method would throw exception at runtime   in windows forms toolkit there is a handy control called the numericupdowncontrol   calendarview control that consumes the calendarmonthview   calendarview supports arrows that appear when hovered allowing mouse users to switch months   calendarview supports mouse scroll to switch months   current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts   there may be trusting problems   repro project https github com riverar dragdropwobblyrepro   we are experiencing an issue where the presence of a passwordbox with a numericpin inputscope overrides the inputscope of other controls on the page until the passwordbox has received focus   on a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our uwp app that has a numericpin scoped passwordbox   build and run the app   keyboard remains numericpin   see that the inputscopes of the textboxes are now honored   before doing anything else click the show touch keyboard button in the notification tray such that the touch keyboard appears   i think i found a problem in media player   in this case

systemmediatransportcontrols pause button click mediaplayer systemmediatransportcontrols buttonpressed event and on phone call i can correctly stop my player and change some states   i ve looked into using a softwarebitmapsource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and i m not sure whether its dispose method works doesn t affect memory shown in vs debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator   i am preloading images for speed and i need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling gc collect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory   compact overlay window is always shown at the right top corner   this would help in hit testing of visuals   more details can be found in this issue   we can see the support of communities in uwpcommunitytoolkit   as a self learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things   i hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind   specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user dev in

htwdhtsgx pfkcweq   page has no more safe area but on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part within the page   for full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video   that s an real issue   i am removing the safe area by calling setdesiredbounds and i am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page   i debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by microsoft   in my app i am using custom transport controls and i used the original template as a starting point   this is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above   nevertheless i would expect a less hacky solution   and fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it s name is not present   but when we play a video file using mediastreamsource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create mediastreamdescriptors for them   so audio and video works but subtitles don t work   i am unable to use containers and vmware virtualbox on windows at the same time due to the restriction of hyper v   this restriction does not exist on linux and macos   it doesn t seem to quite have an equivalent in uwp in order to get even spacing of a grid automatically as well as other features like setting rows columns and first column for calendar type applications   a

pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every ms   there are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type   or you display search results for various item types in one view   but it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones   now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control   but it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which more   desktop bridge attracts me as a developer but windows store puts me off   there are no keyword searches   this has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it   there are many threads on internet discussing this issue but windows store team doesn t seem to listen   currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names   this has been like that for many years but no more   otherwise the private store can only be used for in house apps or free apps   this crash occurs in all javascript apps that use the mediacapture api to display camera video previews   for this reason apps programmed in javascript that use video or photo capturing are from now on non functional in windows   according to the documentation it is possible to x bind events to a handler   so for

by state changes   let s assume i have objects which are soft particles sp   and objects that are triangle meshes tm   both sp and tm use alpha blending   sp don t do depth writes but they do depth tests and depth reads in the shader   so both sp and tm do legal operations they don t write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time   however in the worst case when sp and tm are ordered in the following way   to my understanding omsetrendertargets is a slow operation but i need to call it times   that way would be very beneficial   i don t need to call omsetrendertargets for

  the site is faster in chrome and ie but still not fast and gives a poor user experience due to the lack of performance   currently it is at risk of giving the impression of being neglected more   i

all the items   unfortunately it looks like the ui components in this case a listbox cannot deal with the add and multiple items   the event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes all covered by unit tests   for some notes on the investigation see https github com catel catel issues   i think this is a bug in the way the ui components deal with the

still not mature and still has bugs   interestingly apps wrapped with desktop bridge do not have to use net native   when using a company store account with associated developer accounts its presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for store problems   this is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the master account name and

this is a security norm from microsoft to not allow outside settings finguer detection   thank you jose lopes   it detects finguers   im now developing a uwp app for multiuser registration using

device is connected to a network speech recognition with local srgs custom grammar it behaves exactly as if it did not have the local grammar and starts to communicate to the websockets platform bing

soundended and the resultgenerated event is invoked is very small less than ms   even the official microsoft uwp sample accuses the same problem   for large teams just having one team member being able to do this is a bad design decision   the api is fine but where i m running into trouble is that things like flyouts and dialogs intercept any and all access to the event   event registration order doesn t seem to make a difference   this makes for problems with things like   cached splitview with ispaneopen true inside a frame that is navigated forward   the splitview captures the first

suggested videos from different channels are shown in single row   when the user will press button for next items then items will scroll and next set of items will appear on the more   i haven t found any possible way to do that so i assume it doesn t exist currently   the serialdevice implementation appears to be very unstable in general but doubly so when compiling as native   the following will

adjustment for the month of ramadan shaban though which can vary per region user some users like to use the adjustment of a different country   the windows calender app show cases this feature with their calender when you set the alternative calender to hijri a new setting shows up which is hijri adjustment and it works nice   i don t know how they achieved this though because there is no known

am using a uk keyboard layout and keys such as do not work   applicationview suppresssystemoverlays has been deprecated for a while and the warning message says use tryenterfullscreenmode instead   however there s an important difference in behavior that has prevented is from switching   when you use full screen mode statusbar showasync doesn t work   to give you some context why this matters to us our app is a video streaming app with both vod and live tv content   when the user starts video playback on a phone we use suppresssystemoverlays to hide the navigation bar on devices such as lumia that has them and status bar   but we turn the status bar back to visible along with other playback controls when the user taps the screen   the information in the status bar is highly relevant to a video app   sure we could replace the status bar with our own ui containing the same info   when the user starts video playback on a phone we use suppresssystemoverlays to hide the navigation bar on devices such as lumia that has them more   it seems it s still not possible to submit edge extensions to the store   i think it s almost over a year   currently the win d directionalblureffect is marked as nocomposition and can t be used with composition apis both in the creator s update and the new insider builds for the fall creator s update   dotnet framework can uncompressed and open this application or user interface   once this client part is done we can have rest api s returning json data while maintaining session on server   this new model of develpement can be used for both windows and web applciations   so only differnce that makes it a windows application and web aplication is the url if pointing to local its gonnabe windows standalone app elses its gone be web app   which shoudl be configurable   as soon this gets in to market due to the ease of development this should boom which eventually kill browser like chrome there angular concept thus again giving microsoft a opportunity to beat others   to label the developer as net developer instead of windows developer or web application developer   if i use anywhere in my uwp app bitmapicon with urisource about blank this can happen when using databinding the app crashes when navigating to other page which contains webview   tested on windows creators update vs   repro is available in zip below   let s imagine that you drew a rectangle with yellow rounded corners and added the following text in it login right after you ve grouped it and now you want this to be a button simply you click convert to button and then click on toggle for xaml or click show xaml code and copy to clipboard then you just paste the code in xamarin forms in visual studio   this would make life easier for millions of developers   i m working on a motion blur effect as post process for which i m storing velocities into a render target   however now i m stuck using dxgi format r g b a snorm   both timepicker and timepickerflyout support hour and minute and period am pm selection   however second selection is often very useful and needed   the contenttemplateselector is broken when binding to viewmodels   this is a significant bug and kind of hard to believe it hasn t been fixed   the following link appears to refer to the same bug   after seven months the issue still has not been addressed   you ll get an error if the type of vm data is not object   represents a control that contains audio and or video   natively supported transition effects between one media and another   supports natively playing a playlist as an input ie a collection of uris   infinite loop reproduction   video overlay support for example picture in picture   native support of svg animation with smil inside xaml for beautiful and responsive ui and hardware acceleration backend on opengl direct d vulkan metal   the advantage of xaml to natively support svg with smil is that you as a developer would not have to worry about these icons and animations the design or animator could do that in other software and deliver svgs to you   in addition to being able to search on the internet svg animated icons ready to use   these are widely used in the real world today   in several areas we find these types of control such as audio video playes visual programming animation software single multitracks audio editors video editors slide editors photo gallery websites social networks among many others   the backgroundtasks can currently be launched every minutes by the timetrigger   unfortunately if a task is launched via this timetrigger but appears idle to the operating system then it is suspended   this means the task can not execute for the full minute window   my current backgroundtask has a timer in it which would allow my background task to wake up on a timer event periodically do some processing then wait again   this low amount of processing looks to be idle so gets suspended   if you either leave idle tasks alone they are idle so not using system resources right   i like the way mspoweruser app has implemented this feature   in that app if we click continue reading button it will show all the devices connected to this device   so if i click on a device it will open the app on that device with the same artice   the street and streetnumber property of the maplocationfinder findlocationsasync results have no value   however street and house number are included correctly in the formattedaddress property   this bug occurs sine the creators update   it does not have any sense to be forced to compile c# net for all targets prior to uploading package to windows store   what if microsoft adds arm target tomorrow   i handle rendering the entire interface with my own commands using directx rendering   this works briliantly with just few lines of code   which means there s no real simple api for uwp to do this and what i want is a simple api   so many things to do compared to just drag and drop   also i ve followed your links and it really sounds awfully complicated honestly i don t know where to start   for example i drag and drop c folder image bmp file onto my app window and my app will generate c folder image png so what i need is a simple api like void onfilesdropped string file names int window client pos x int window client pos y where file names is an array of full path names of all files folders drag and dropped onto the app and other parameters are the xy coordinates of the client window position where the drag and drop occured   i don t want to use a file picker or xaml   i handle rendering the entire interface with my more   mark r for the win tegration   this is most like   app service is not real time and not bi direction   i ve done some tests and to my surprise dxgi swap effect flip discard instead of bringing performance improvements it slows things down   nvidia geforce m gt latest videos drivers april may   windows latest updates may   i ve made a simple application all it did was just clear the backbuffer several times and presented the screen   in v sync mode i ve cleared it more times to get below fps limit   why are you limiting uwp and directx to flip mode that is slower   while bc is great the bc quality is not really good however we still need small size for textures as my game is currently over gb of texture data   what happened to astc texture format   originally this was supposed to be included in directx but later was scrapped   are we going to see it eventually   currently i m using only texture formats   if you have relocated your user folder somewhere else and the older downloads folder remains if you add the old storagefolder to the storageapplicationpermissions futureaccesslist   currently it is really painful to add new controls from newer windows sdk versions to apps and still support older versions   ways this could potentially be fixed   this would be really helpful when it comes to upcoming fluent design supporting new fluent design styles and supporting the design waves   like how xamarin forms does it instead of more   i am especially interested in how this would work for my app to span different hardware types regardless of form factor or os the idea of a seamless experience between windows desktop and android or ios mobile is compelling but i need to see some examples before i invest   i ve read about project rome and the possibility of creating cross device experiences https blogs windows com buildingapps cross device experience with project rome and am particularly interested in the project rome android sdk https blogs windows com buildingapps announcing project rome android sdk #hql ibqtugyzrufw   a it is extremely slow   b it draws mappolygons blurred with jagged borders   c it draws mappolylines in wrong positions very very often   they take right position then after manual shifting of map but initially of them are misplaced after being added to mapelements collection   most often it occurs near map borders   the sdk itself support the side by side installation then we can try the new api with our uwp apps   but there are no way to distribute this kind of app to testers or customers that use win insider preview   it only allow the customer update sdk level   you know many of microsoft apps are updated with new sdk and it ll be available at the store during insider preview   for example ms provide the lot of sdk and new technologies about win fall cu   this is really a must for apps that target businesses or wish must to support older devices that will not get the latest versions   uwp media element or mediaplayerelement are fantastic with ui but their codecs to play different kinds of audio and video files is very limited   thankyou   how can we ensure registration is complete for the com server without adding regsvr command in post build and setting linker value for register output to false   we see an error class not

that this not currently supported   this would be insane   i have reported sales information from many other sources   the webproxy property does not seem to have an impact on windows systems   when i try to call launchuriasync or launchfileasync in tablet mode the calling app will not show on the top app is loading and goes to background   i see only start menu tiles   it hasn t to be a full fledged docking mdi control like the ones from   it appears that the mapicon rendering by the mapcontrol has changed significantly with the windows creators update   we have an app that at times adds hundreds of mapicon objects to the mapcontrol   before creators update this worked fine and the vast majority if not all were displayed   after creators update we are only seeing a small portion of the mapicon objects being rendered onto the map   and it s not because they are colliding with other mapicons   we are seeing large portions of the map not displaying any of the mapicons we ve added   we have always been aware of the guidance that a mapicon is not guaranteed to be displayed but it s never been a problem   we ve even tried setting mapelementcollisionbehavior remainvisible but it doesn t make much difference   it seems like there s now some sort of internal limit on how many mapicons are displayed at a time   i couldn t find anything in the release notes about this change   is this change in behavior expected or a bug   the uwp scrollbar is white and is invisible on a light background   it can only be seen on a dark background   the skeleton tracking is not working on xbox   mediaframesourcekind custom is not available on the xbox   it is available on the pc though   as a result skeletal tracking apps do not work on the xbox platform   the uwp application platform has a rich media api which allows querying of a video device e g   the kinect and seeing if it supports things like exposurecontrol   the auto exposure function causes major headaches for the app i m working on and i would dearly love to be able to turn it off   i ve noticed that when you create a datapackage containing both data provided directly let s say text using setdata and delayed formats like a bitmap using setdataprovider when closing the application the whole clipboard content is cleared   in vs and maybe in the compiler raised a warning that we missed that stated some of our code was currently unsupported by the uwp toolchain   this led to a runtime crash that took a long time to figure out   warning sg cannot generate serialization code for type   the methodname property of the knowntypeattribute on type objectmodel entities basething is not currently supported   like you are already doing with the xaml part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched   it could save us developers a lot of time   there is only one direction for the radial progress bar control clockwise   but the xbox one doesn t provide any diagnostics data of apps e g   memory cpu consumption etc   there is a section for that in the device portal but there is currently not data   users are asking me frequently for a xbox version of my app   it s just the same like with mobile   here we have several emulators and i usually make use of them first instead of plugging a device immediately   even more important xbox has a limited api with respect to desktop and mobile   networkinformation object not available etc   personally i won t enable xbox without having tested my app first at least in an emulator   unfortunately i do not own a xbox nor would getting one make sense it is a free app so i am not really interested in spending lots of money just for developing purpose   here we have several emulators and i usually make use of them first instead of more   in windows messages for example there is a very nice control for entering selecting contacts to send an email or text message etc to   the control would include a field for required contactfieldtypes   the fileopenpicker has the suggestedstartlocation and the official description of how it works is   the suggestedstartlocation is not always used as the start location for the file picker   in this situation suggestedstartlocation makes it more confusing because when the user tries to pick a music file the fileopenpicker is opening in the pictureslibrary   so suggestedstartlocation remembers where you were and continues to open that same folder every time   mobile phone cpu temperature   i noticed this problem as soon as i adapted my app to use imageex   i use an event to change opacity to once the image is loaded and sized and immediately i noticed that instead of just displaying the image faded in with a second animation   this animation seems hard coded into the style so to get rid of it i would have to redefine the style   a real pain just to get rid of the animation   one of the problems i encounter is my inability to get jack info as in iksjackdescription getjackdescription   i saw new post and i confirmed that the problem was fixed following url   thanks for fixing an issue   but i noticed that it still happens no sound issue in another situation   ofcourse i m using windwos creators update version   neither foreground nor fulltrustprocess   it sounds normally after reboot os   we have a very large wpf application built upon the virtual earth api with heavy customization of the rendering pipeline   currently multiselectmodel does not work as documented   player your app is activated one time   all of the selected files are passed to your app as argument parameters   as far as anniversary update and creators update are concerned multiselectmodel has no effect and only one file is passed as argument to the application regardless of how many files have been selected in explorer   please support the passing of all selected files as command arguments   all the documentation on how to call uwp methods are in c# and require the net platform   is there a low level c interface as well   many developer will be bringing java python etc applications to the windows store via the desktop bridge   master panel in masterdetailsview was intended to be used as pulltorefreshlistview because usually the listview in master panel is dynamically changing it is often used for showing collections of emails articles etc   it would save the user a lot of time and effort   future access list is great in theory but adds too much overhead   how uwp apps can compete with other systems with such things   not mentioning that some kind of apps need more than file access why to give such a handicap for the whole platform   btw seems that futureaccesslist sometimes has bugs and people are leaving platform and more   make datatemplate behave like xamarin forms datatemplate class where you have constructors   datatemplate func object this one provides lot of flexibility   the windows store analytics api is great   the most important data is the conversions breakdown by campaign id table at the bottom of the page   currently uwp can t open wasapi output devices in capture mode due to com restrictions   this means loopback auto capture is not supported   until now i can t find any api or documents about this   we have a mediaplayer that works with onedrive mkv streams in previous versions but not in creators update   player raises sourcenotsupported error   now that the markdowntextblock control supports fenced code blocks in version language specific syntax highlighting would be the next step e g   but that would be beyond what the control should do in terms of separation of concerns   the function would get the original text and is expected to return either xaml objects or maybe a more abstract of

  for example one thing i can t do right now is a simple search popup that would let me keep focus in where i m searching similar to how search in cortana works   background audio playback working on

resets them every reboot   when you view an exception you get a completely useless stacktrace with only hex values for function names because of optimization   we can t use that at all   this enumeration is mainly used with appbarbutton like as appbarbutton icon smile   recent segoe mdl asset have many of new glyphs   but the enumeration of symbol is not updated from win   and some of important glyphs of are also lacked from the enumeration   for example share glyph xe d is not enumerated   but many of developers don t   like photo app   this cause the many of engineers use the bitmap or other similar glyphs   this is still happening i ve tested it myself now after the update to   my users are also reporting the same problem and some of them say they resign of the app platform   and i must say that i completely understand them   how we the developers are supposed to work when such important thing like access to files is not working after the os update   this affects many of the apps and in result the whole platform   the futureaccesslist has an issue   after a firmware update for my phone i was unable to retrieve folders files from a token   the token i

you set the heder value you cannot clear it as the method   this method can be called multiple times for the same header   the values will then be concatenated   the problem comes when we want to create multiple downloads with one downloader if the server requires to send request via headers we are not able to downloaded files items within one downloader every item requires to create a new downloader instance with new headers   of course in that case we cannot use grouped toast notification   request for an editable combo box that allows   currently page breaks are not supported with the printhelper   currently it is possible to specify multiple groups subgroups within the various tile sizes for adaptive tiles but if the content doesn t fit then some groups won t necessarily ever be shown they are dropped since the tile can t fit the groups   i recently browsed the uwp docs and found some interesting apis about accessory management etc   for me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but i do not want to create a company account for this   without apis you are losing customers to android ios as many people would love to have apps which can control their volume system theme etc   current steps are outlined here   since i developed an application which could massively profit from those apis as they allow volume control etc i wanted to use them   unfortunately for me i cannot use those apis as they are restricted for use and getting access is only possible with a company developer account which i do not have   for me it is perfectly acceptable to request access to them so they are still under control but i do not want to create more   i have lost count of the number of times i ve forgot to set it to oneway   yes i know why it isn t but looking at my code nearly every instance is set to oneway or twoway anyway   on both the mobile and desktop versions of the store app you can browse these categories   however this feature is not present in the store app on the xbox   unless your app makes it into the top apps sections or promoted apps then users can only download your app if they know about it and search for it by name themselves   if their app like mine is published solely to the xbox then it makes it very hard for users to become aware of your app   when you publish an app in dev center it allows you to select the category and subcategory for the app to be placed into   if their app like mine is published solely to the xbox then it makes it more   if you have no more disk space the install crashed   the combination of toasts and action center provide a convenient lightweight way to communication with users but after notifications are read they disappear   i m currently working on a clock control for my uwp todo list app day www day app com   i m creating this control using inspiration from the great material design wpf toolkit   the very early work in progress version is available on my repo https github com japf uwp material clock   in uwp we have a commandbar but it seems it s not easy to use to build a classic toolbar for a desktop application   but as this is such a central control it should be part of the platform   i ve spent some hours to build a small mvvm uwp pivot prototype that does the typical stuff we do today in wpf with tabcontrol   and i was impressed how far i got   currently the pivot has no overflow panel   it s also not wrapping the headers   i didn t find the option   i created a separate uservoice entry   styling of content i was not able to get rid of that entrance animation slide in from the left animation transition   allow for no overflow   allow for no wrapping   big asks are asks are more   you re building on a treeview control as your backlog on https developer microsoft com en us windows platform shows   i m using the treeview of your official samples on https github com microsoft windows universal samples tree dev samples xamltreeview   the point that i really miss when working with hierarchical data is the hierarchicaldatatemplate like we have it today in wpf   it makes especially sense when you release a control for hierarchical data like the treeview   entries as limit for futureaccesslist is way to low   best practice until now   store the folder containing the file wont exceed the limit as fast as storing each file in the futureaccesslist   one exception where a folder can t be added   a big downside hides in dragdrop https docs microsoft com en us windows uwp app to app drag and drop   to counter that and trying to add the folder from the file this won t be possible because an exception would be thrown even if you added the file itself to the futureaccesslist before that   example trying to add folder from dragdrop filetarget to futureaccesslist   we re not able to add this folder   i don t for how long but i noticed it a few days back that there is a change in de windows app store seacchresults   pc apps are harder to find this way   also i noticed that in the mobile store apps are shown twice after search with a keyword   is this new policy or is it a bug   when building line of business apps for enterprises we often focus on desktop only   today we re using wpf for these tasks   similar request but a report control for rdlc support   currently it is nearly impossible to create a custom virtualizing panel   but in uwp it is impossible because the base classes have private constructors and the other classes are sealed   a lot of custom controls do not use virtualization because it is so hard to implement in uwp   this makes the controls hard or even impossible to use with large collections   adcontrol on xbox in retail mode crashes app works fine in dev mode or on desktop mobile   something has changed in the microsoft store services sdk framework or in the microsoft advertising sdk for xaml library that is updated automatically to the xbox since february th   to repro download any app from the store which contains ads and it will instantly crash on the spash screen   all the other platforms support this net silverlight android xamarin and even ios xamarin   why is the uwp team stubbornly resisting this   other platforms allow for customization to be downloaded and dynamically loaded in to the app domain   with apps increasingly going the encrypted route our app eartrumpet is finding it harder and harder to retrieve the running appx app s current application icon i e   apis is messy and not appropriate for loading scale sensitive assets   parsing the pri is only possible in unencrypted appx scenarios   the current options have the current drawbacks for me   there are genuine use cases when we need to keep an app running when close button is pressed   you can only allow an app to catch close button event and minimise it to task bar programatically   currently i have to save a mp stream to a file and then read from the file and transmit it over tcp   one scenario is that of a shoutcast source for internet radio streaming   a shoutcast source transmits mp data via tcp to a shoutcast server   currently an in process appservice can be invoked without actually launching the main app ui   however once a user launch the main app ui and close it appservice is also terminated because both shared same process   this control is not to be confused with the existing pivot viewer in uwp   this control makes a great addition for displaying large amounts of data in a visual friendly format   the control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations   this was the original microsoft link for the pivot control in silverlight   related to feature request   it might be necessary to ensure the downloaded base images are not corrupted and it would be very nice for you to provide them   i cannot port my windows phone silverlight app to uwp because it is depending on the panorama control which is missing in uwp   the hub control is not a suitable replacement   use case as neither groove nor spotify have a lyrics functionality anymore i created a simple uwp app to manage lyrics for songs   following data would be great   linked to github https github com microsoft uwpcommunitytoolkit issues   there is systemtriggertype powerstatechange but it is not triggered when percent is changed   so one of two options would be useful   right now to show something on lock screen we have text and icon notifications at the bottom   there is no way to implement complex text markup rendering without direct d or slow manual composition inside canvas control   there is absolutely no easy way to implement selectable text with complex markup   richeditbox control exists but there is no lightweight control for just display rich text richtextblock isn t related to richeditbox and feature lame   the toastnotification object has a convenient expirationtime property that automatically dismisses it after a given period   unfortunately the scheduledtoastnotification which is just a toastnotofcation but scheduled lacks this helping feature   this makes me as a developer scracth my head and write a lot of code including background tasks just so i circumvent this problem and not have the users of my app get crowded with not so relevant anymore notifications in their action center   the mapcontrol is quite limited in operations with custom tiles   i have need to redraw the tiles periodically because they become outdated the closest similar example is traffic layer which needs to be periodically refreshed   even more since this operation results in tiles flickering because of redraw i have to use tile sources switching between them   that crasy staff involves heavy redrawing of the map and it also leads to visble scrolling slowing down in the moment of maptilesource adding which would be nice to fix too   the ugly workaround i use is adding and removing maptilesource which forces tiles redraw   currently uwp apps have no ability to include menu controls with excellent mouse support   one click to close the first menu and a second click to open the new one   at the moment there is no possibility to quickly navigate through long lists on small screens   but sometimes lists are not in alphabetic order or there are still thousands of entries starting with the same letter   i don t know what the component should look like   if the list is alphabetic there is at least the possibility to jump to the first entry with the same first letter   i want to test my apps in multiple languages without changing the region of my entire device   i m developing a windows universal app and i m sicked and tired of finding a way to implement encrypted local db support   i already have a database file encrypted by sql cipher and i just have to read the records   but sqlcipher is not it supports only commercial edition and i can t afford the expense   surprisingly no one of them supports universal app implementation   that s ridiculous and i m sick and tired of finding the way   does microsoft really not support local database in developing universal app   i can t understand why i m confused in this situation which is possible on android or ios so easy   i know sqlite support universal app development through nuget in vs   that s ridiculous and i m sick and tired more   basic scenario is the need to store set of secret api keys for various rd party apis twitter for example   just to hardcode api keys inside app executable files is security risk as it can be reverse engeneered   hello there is currently a bug withing the insider preview for desktop and phone   mouse scrolling works fine and it was also tested on the normal windows builds where it was working as intended   and i created this thread on the msdn forum where it was confirmed that this is an insider preview bug https social msdn microsoft com forums windowsapps en us af b e a a a fb da b uwpwinjslistview items cannot be invoked after scrolling the listview with the touchscreen forum wpdevelop   you can also find a code sample here   i found this thread on github https github com winjs winjs issues   could do something like   td style my teste here td   this is reproducible in the xamlanimatedgif sample app on win desktop   notice animated gifs appear   at least one of the animated gifs will disappear   eventually they all disappeared for me   this facility exist for public store apps but not lob ones   i find myself writing this control over and over in various projects and it s never vey good   allow panning and zooming   it also creates a large hurdle for new users and causes a number of headaches   the issue is that our software uses ui access to emulate an onscreen touchpad and custom gestures   we also allow for simultaneous pen and touch to add touch keyboard hotkeys to a docked custom keyboard typically aids in drawing and ink based applications   i love what you guys are doing and can not tell you enough how much anticipation i have to get in touch with you guys and find the answers to these questions   it would mean the world to me   our question is would converting our app to use newer windows ink code forgive my lack of knowledge here and if more   here are some more things i would appreciate   the scaling of the website sometimes doesn t work   i don t know if it is only me but i can t kill a running process but i can stop a running app   execution on every restart   text and parts of graphs are not wisible because it disappears below   i don t know if it is only me but i can t more   currently smartcard api doesn t have any method to force a reader to reset smartcard cold reset or warm reset as described in iso   it is important as fallback mechanism when the smart card is not responding   this is really way too long in uwp xaml not addressed   public static readonly dependencyproperty istestproperty dependencyproperty register nameof istest typeof bool   i have two versions of my app one for windows phone v x x x and another one for windows mobile v x x x   latter uses new features of windows and receives excellent reviews but store mixes them with worse ratings from windows phone users   my app users are reporting that they can t get information about my durable add on on the xbox one and xbox one s   when my code checks for the property addonlicenses the collection is empty for users that have purchased the add on   we have tried with extendedjsondata property but the add on array is empty too   we can t determine if the add on is active and neither the expiration date   when user invoke the access key of a button to navigate out the accesskeydisplaydismissed event of the command bar button isn t invoked   when the user pressed the access key of a button to navigate out the tooltips of command bar buttons stay where they are   if a url is required then either i have to use something like onedrive which i think looks a bit unprofessional or i have to create a web page which requires hosting etc and either way it creates an extra separate thing for me to have to manage and remember   i would prefer it if everything to do more   when using windows media transcoding mediatranscoder to transcode alac file to something else it reports codecnotfound   however alac decoding is supported according to this page https msdn microsoft com en us windows uwp audio video camera supported codecs#desktop   more interestingly transcoding other files to alac works fine   privateobject and privatetype are missing in microsoft visualstudio testplatform unittestframework   on this page there is explanation how to make a file explorer integration on a desktop bridge app   i m working on porting an app that could calculate md checksums on a file   i want to add this as a context menu option on for instance zip and iso files   also there is no way to having different verbs on different file types which could be quite limiting   but it s not possible to do this without making a file type association as i get it more   we have a uwp in the store and a desktop companion app   currently to install our software and have it function both programs are needed   the issue we run into is that our desktop app uses ui access   is ui access support on the list of upcoming features   having a good informed answer to this question will help tremendously in helping us understand how to proceed   i would be beyond excited to get a response   it would mean the world to our small team to hear from you all   some of our ui access features may be convertible to direct ink functionality would that be a worthwhile pursuit or would that leave us facing the same intersection from a different direction   our app is called tablet pro it may be of use to know that   building our email list has been at the forefront of our small software companies goals for a few years   probably the biggest question i have is how to use the store without loosing our ability to acquire user emails without complicating the process for the end user   i may simply be unaware of how this is done   this would be huge   we like a number of the benefits the store offers but it seems without a way to build an list of our clients independent of microsoft or anyone but us for that matter is key   is there a process in place for gaining downloaders email addresses   since the advent of silverlight pivotviewer control shifted the handling of large datasets giving a way of filtering and analyzing large volumes of data   for line of business applications processing large datasets   currently the scrollviewer s content can be overpanned   support the last version of net standard   developing desktop apps for uwp is subpar as many api are not present like sqlclient   the store does not allow a developer to update their response to a user s review once it is made public while users are allowed to update their reviews at will   a user may change his review completely and the original response could become totally irrelevant   i am attempting to design something to support functionality similar to android s startactivityforresult using the page stacks but i have no visibility into the management of the page stacks backstack and forwardstack   this introduces the opportunity for a memory leak as these stacks are pruned in response to user navigations   winrt information the maximum number of items in the access list has been reached   this supports the use case for providing a detail view for both the underlying item represented by the group header template as well as that of the represented by the itemtemplate   currently i am prohibited from extending and overridding various methods in my case those concerning navigation   as a long time wp and now w m user i noticed inconsistent behavior of opening flyout with touch versus mouse   instead in w m it opens just when i release the finger   this is very annoying as i never know if there is some additional menu under the item or not   context menu appears while my finger is still touching the screen   but when using touch gesture i would expect behavior known from wp flyout aka context menu should open after couple miliseconds while my finger is still touching the given item   i use imfsourcereader on uwp and noticed following bug with flac decoding it will not change position if setcurrentposition will be called right after initialization   it is working correct with mp and other codecs but not with flac   this would allow apps to say they were listening to kexp instead only and the station information as well   with silverlight in windows phone i had the ability to use fm radio apis   in uwp i cannot use these apis as they weren t brought over   from an accessory device like a smartwatch possible   our desktop application provides users with custom contact data that we d like to sync for them with windows contacts   we are working on the converted version of the app to enable such capabilities and to distribute our desktop app via the windows store but we have to distribute it for previous versions of windows as well and so we can t afford having two completely different versions of the product for the time being   why do you always have to make a developer s life difficult   there s no easy way to detect left control key pushes   because on international keyboards if right alt is pressed then left control is also pressed   why oh why this is the stupidest thing ever   but that doesn t work too because now it turns out that if i press just rightalt then i can get callbacks for leftctrl and rightalt happening in different frames   onkeydown with leftctrl gets called in frame   onkeydown with rightalt gets called in frame   waiting for reply   so i ve developed a work around to detect key pushes for leftctrl and rightalt and if both are pressed at the same time then leftctrl pushes are ignored   i want my user to stay inside my app   i m using the result of midioutport getdeviceselector for the device selector string   the deviceinformation for some of the virtual software ports on the system are returning with generic device names   a user of ymidi contacted me about this problem   he s using loopmidi a virtual midi loopback from tobias erichsen   have you seen this behavior before   i m using the property deviceinformation name in my application to display the port name   using deviceinformation findallasync in my c cx application to enumerate existing midi ports on the system   we just switched to win sdk and are now getting some new warnings in cpp files with #include windows h   warning is an extra one we have enabled beyond warning level   c program files x windows kits include um winioctl h warning c win winnt win th is not defined as a preprocessor macro replacing with for #if #elif compiling source file src win appinsightswin cpp   similar issue https wpdev uservoice com forums universal windows platform suggestions allow to develop and test windows phone apps on al   currently any uwp developer is forced to use c for accessing directx features or rely on third party support like sharpdx or unity d for those features   currently a control will not be able to handle the request if the event has already been subscribed to in order to handle navigation   this gave the masterdetailsview the time it needed to subscribe to the event first in order to handle it   in other projects frameworks like template this is not as easily handled because those frameworks have a navigation service that subscribes to the backrequested event first   the only work around i found for the sample app was to unsubscribe from the event in the shell when the frame has navigated and then subscribe to the event again in the more   but i mostly care about windows phone   i can see the tasks but i can t terminate them   i know you have tweaked alarm volume in insider builds but you simply cannot cover all user need if you don t provide them the slider   many users still complains about given volume even fade in doesn t save the situation   i assume it s the image for either the left or right eye   when hololens is in stereo mode show both frames on the emulator   apparently the uielement keyup and uielement keydown events provide the wrong virtualkey information in the keyroutedeventargs   the problem is when using a physical keyboard and also when using the on screen keyboard   ibm layout the virtualkey information is correct   it s also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots more   we re limited at work since we can t use our mobile devices the way we want   right now winappdriver only works on desktop   before our users find them   right now it s not possible to add screenshots for addons in windows store   this is especially limiting when browsing dlcs for games without any screenshots   for example the minimum requirements operating system windows or later required   however i am developing a chinese zh tw app using mapcontrol on my computer   unfortunately we can t set the mapcontrol language by programming to a specific value   mapcontrol always uses the windows display language   it is inconvenient for me to debug a chinese app with mapcontrol while my favorite windows display languages is en us   i hardly understand why store app dev center requires azure ad account for adding managers   this work is not viable to indi devs https wpdev uservoice com forums universal windows platform suggestions allow multiple microsoft accounts to manage a dev   my app contains in app purchases but customers can not buy these in app purchases in the windows store for business   but that has a very big impact on maintenance because we would have to support apps   obviously the free sdk is a good start   the current windows audio driver design only allows you to use channels simulatenously   there are many devices like a usb madi or dante virtual soundcard which use at least channels   this is a real problem   i really hope this will change in the near future because for pro audio applications something really has to change   currently document function is disabled   downloadoperation backgroundtransfer api restarts from when resumed after being paused at progress bytesreceived progress totalbytestoreceive and startasync task hasn t completed   the language swift was created by apple for use on ios and macos   it was made open source in   desktop app converter constantly

bluetooth work well but the mobilebroadband is in this value is defined for future use and is not currently available   thank you   hello all   this would mimic the android capability that already exists for its navigation drawer   i have actually implemented this in one of my apps so you can see it in action   it is in an app called drudge live https www microsoft com store apps wzdncrdm m and in the app the swipe open capability is only enabled on phones   based on feedback i have received the capability is very important because it allows the use and opening of hamburger menus on phones using one hand   i was previously getting a lot of grief over the switch to a hamburger menu by phone users but this gives them back the ability to navigate with one hand on the phone   however there seems to be no such accommodation for style definitions located either in resourcedictionary files or embedded directly into the page xaml   in code there is a way to detect and work with features that are in newer windows builds using apiinformation so that code can use new features while gracefully degrading on older builds   if you have a style that uses a new property or enumeration value anyone opening the app in an older win build will immediately crash   it s a lot easier to build a following when it s free   keeping this in mind was thinking of making some of my products donationware   the ability for an end user to donate allows me to make the app free   support for developers willing to get the apps converted and placed in the windows store is below anecdotal   like thousands of other developers i have tried for now over a month to convert my app and followed every literatureput up by microsoft but am still stuck with dependencies   tried to post in uwp apps but questions remain unanswered   for such a strategic move where the windows store could remain indigent as during the painful windows x era if nothing is done please make sure developers do not remain in the more   i was working with webview to display static html and i found an issue   the li table tags are displayed very small in size   you can check using below example   the wns currently does not seem to support loc key loc args apns equivalents   as a result all of the notification strings have to be generated server side iterating for all the languages supported by the client like https azure microsoft com en us documentation articles notification hubs ios xplat localized apns push notification   this causes us to treat the windows platform as a special case while apns gcm provide a single cohesive story   this gets even more painful when we work with client application teams that want to customize the localized strings for their platform for a loc key loc args contract   this gets even more painful when we work with client application teams more   currently the xaml engine of uwp does not manage complex control attributes since it does not take system componentmodel typeconverter into account   that is why we can not write this simple xaml user code   where the complex property is begin and the complex value is that represents a position x y   by the way that will be a lot simpler than the wpf s typeconverter   after having tried typeconverter on uwp i tried to add implicit operators casts to the complex type position here from and to string but xaml does not take them into account   all my tests and researches made be waste two days for nothing   tested with vs under windows   once you create a coreindependentinputsource touch visual feedback is visible again   even if you disabled it using   it s not about aesthetics visualfeedback kills performance the framerate in games drops by half which is ironic if you think that s the kind of apps coreindependentinputsource was created for in the first place   coreindependentinputsource has it s own dispatcher does that mean it has it s own hwnd message queue   maybe that s the cause of the bug pointervisualizationsettings getforcurrentview is tied to the main window   i got the hwnd from coreindependentinputsource dispacher using the vs debug inspector and then called trydisablewindowsvisualfeedback as seen here http stackoverflow com questions disable touch visual feedback on windows programmatically desktop app   the visual feedback was disabled   however live code has no access to that hwnd   all helpful win apis fail one way or another getactivewindow getproccessid enumwindows etc   wack will be an error by some applications   wack show an error occurred while generating the report   of couse another app have success of wack   i have a question related wack   when this issue specified test features   then can t show apps list so i selected an appx package   to choose what test features is it right   i have a question related more   i need to select multiple files to be downloaded uploaded one time   i also want to create folders to store things in   seriously while we see a lot of improvement of asp net razor languages and even the c# language reducing a lot of verbosity in each version with a lot of awesome new features xaml got what in the last years   seriously to be honest we lose a lot of features with transition of wpf uwp dockpanels adorners etc   in windows store the longer app s titles or capitalized app s titles for example cobata x html constructor are cut to characters doing the app s title meaningless for example cobata x html   it is because the responsible html element c heading class font size style property is fixed to px   how this could work more   when there is a bulk update requirement as with the age ratings and soon to be with the ad support changes the store is poorly equipped to server those of us that are managing large portfolios and millions of users   right now i have to manage this myself   the current status only seems to show in progress if the app has never been put in the store before   i have lots of apps that are just now showing that they have passed certification days after simply doing the age rating update   i have lots of apps that are just now showing that they more   right now richeditbox only supports input and output in rtf format   http sys serves as the kernel component backing iis and the net httplistener   there are a number of failure cases such as a high incoming request rate filling the request queue that can result in the module rejecting incoming requests directly without handing them off to callers higher on the stack   information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the httperr log file and a few perf counters   neither is ideal   the log file is system wide requires admin access and lacks any information about what request queue the error is associated with   as such it plays a critical role as the first system to process each incoming http request but it is unfortunately lacking in diagnostics   this leaves the application unaware that it it experiencing such problems   information about these failed requests is currently only visible via the httperr log file and more   and the relativetime it seems not correct sometimes the duration is larger than relativetime   sometimes the previous frame s relativetime is but the next frame s relativetime is   i m confused what the is that   also the audiograph can t to be ensure generate ms of audioframe data even though i have set the quantumsizeselectionmode property to closesttodesired   this is bad for signal analysis scenario   when submitting fixing the age ratings age ratings the dev center will not let me submit more than or in a row   when initiating a chat session the page asks you to let the operator know what the issue is and provides a virtually limitless text field   there is no indication that the text field will only transmit the first characters to the support technician but that apparently is the limit   this ends up further frustrating an already distressed developer and making the job that much harder for the support operator needlessly   this leads the user to have to type again the whole description   the name reservation field doesn t accept spaces   loopmidi is also an example of this in the midi realm allowing on the fly creation destruction renaming of virtual midi ports although lacking the routing filtering layer which midi ox s primitive gui routing filtering is a good example of   some of the above is already possible today there s some virtual audio cable solutions but it s cumbersome non standard and definetely not done optimized   all the above is also somewhat possible today but there s no os based unified paradigm easily controllable by the user   there has been a huge spike in spammers scraping the windows store website for apps support email   the automated script leaves a star review and asks that you do the same for their app   i recenlty rated your app https www microsoft com en us store p hacked nblggh j with stars and caption and text great tool i will admit that installing this app was an ordeal   i want to thank lancelot for taking the time to communicate quickly with me   have an exporter for a adobe xd file that could translate to xaml   and it would be great to have a signed version dxgi format r g b a snorm   add support to allow wcf services to be consumed that have custom username password authentication on the binding   i believe that everyone in xaml lovers we want a robust and complete standard and that facilitates the life of the developer so i propose to include these controls as a standard of xaml specification   or allow minute or maybe even minute timetriggers to be used   i would like from the device portal the ability to reset the device   create a control for continue in different device like continue reading etc   so it would be nice to create controls to achieve microsoft s vision easily   i would like my apps be automatically supported on any new processor architectures   please add simple api   the application xbox dev mode companion should have an option to make it a vr   make it something unique windows phone attracting more customers   have a separate class library that only supports new sdk versions and it will only be loaded into the app on newer sdk versions therefore you can write safe xaml markup including new controls and properties   alternatively it would be nice if the uwp platform was updated separately from windows so apps would be able to support all the new controls styles   there needs to be a way to define new xaml controls properties etc as currently if you want to add these with a lower minimum version it has to be from code behind   i would like to try this out making my app an experience shared across multiple close proximity devices but it would be very helpful to see some code samples   there should be alternative condensed and aligned with win style of controls that we can use to create applications that are looking just like their classical counterparts while benefitting from uwp improvements   i belive that store should control the sdk level more grained   please add background to textblock control   please integrate ffmpeg or vlc libraries by default in these xaml elements to make it easier for developers to build apps that run all kinds of video and audio files   it would be nice to be able to assign a compiled binding to properties through the visualstate setters of xamlbehaviors   please add a delegate version for the propertymetadata create where the dependencyproperty is supplied so you can create a default value for the dependency object instead of a simple default value   please bring all languages to cortana for iot because are needed to create devices for interacting people from around the world   provide semantic animations like fadein fadeout crossfade etc   should also do this for other converters for same behavior   if white background scrollbar should be a different color so it is fully visible   it could be really good to hot reload the app when changing c# or xaml code   it would be great to add a property to choose the direction of the progress bar clockwise or counterclockwise   when notifications are removed from one device they should be removed from all devices by default   i know there are no plans for running uwp apps in windows but a designer would be nice and would virtually remove the need to upgrade to windows before writing apps for it   aside from my personal dilemma of a missing device it would definitely make sense to be able testing code in an emulator first instead of having lots of hardware around all the time   if microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games on a pc then just turn off games   please create actualstartlocation in fileopenpicker so that we can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder we want   please add an api that allows to read the temperature from the device e g   please add the ability to access the rendering pipeline to the mapcontrol class   it would be great if the application executable launcher exe element or the uap extension category windows appexecutionalias element would allow me to specify arguments in the appxmanifest xml file   so why not include enablepulltorefresh as a property of masterdetailsview   it would make developers life much easier if they had a possibility to access files simpler   so my opinion is to create two new controls   one is textcanvas for display and editing both text and inking   it would be great if the roaming folder quota was larger than kb mb at least this would prevent us from having to depend on a network paid service to have great cross device customer experiences   this is not really completely uwp related but microsoft should provide free virtual machines of all windows versions for testing purposes as in my experience uwp is really fragile and could make my app behave differently in every version   do you think that you could make the windows store and other built in apps accessible from the device portal making it a lot easier to install new apps that are already on the store and make changes in settings etc   it would be great if something similar to dependencyobject setcurrentvalue method from wpf would be introduced in the future so that a dependencyproperty can be set to a new value without missing an one way binding   can you please expose the viseme events for the windows speech sythesis   i think it would be useful to have in the toolkit   it would be great to be able to bind invoke scripts inside a webview from a viewmodel like binding a url to a property   symbol enum should be updated with latest segoe mdl asset collections   if the enumeration are updated with the latest mdl glyphs it may helps many of developers who search the correct glyphs   could you please add selectranges ienumerabel itemindexrange itemindexranges to be able to add multiple ranges at once and also make selectedranges property is only get set to be able to replace existing selection ranges   after releasing to refresh the list should animate back to top as a simple list do and while awaitng for the data to be fetched the refresh indicator content should be visible or have a property to control its visibility i would prefer this one   it would be even better if i could have an api that could make the calculations for me and offer up a packet failure retransmission percent or average time between send and acknowledgment   optionally the worker side of async awaitable should accept notification uri in conjunction with type which the type itself may or may not exist on the target of execution in which case it can decide to create exception instance or return typical http message the important part is the contract of return notification should be extended to the application developer in a way that allows to harvest its result in an expected format potentially by polling yet another resource   but either way please do make an api available   providing thos apps would boost uwp as platform and thus create more possibilities for users and developers together   please allow private developers to access those capabilities   i hope everyone can publish fonts on the store   it would be good for developers to specify auto renewal of the durable paid add ons in developer portal so users do not need to repurchase the add on again and again   a toolbar stacks items from left to right and it would be great to have such a toolbar in uwp like we have it today in wpf and several other desktop programming models   if you build it it would be great if you could add configurable close functionality to the tab header that is bindable to a viewmodel   i think this could be made simpler by support for example a headerstyle property on the pivot   maybe the dev should be able to define the panel used for the headers   for a classic desktop application we need a tabcontrol   so i suggest that you bring the hierarchicaldatatemplate to uwp   please increase the limit way up or remove it completley   if you add files from across the filesytem which i do in my app letting the user drop in images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the files limit   increase futureaccesslist limit like in millions   introduce userchoice dialog if accessexception is raised   also as a secondary request let folderpicker suggestedstartlocation also be a folderrelativeid   optional show an user input dialog requesting access to the file or folder and let the user decide   please add a trigger to start a background task when a nearby nfc tag is recognized   it would be more convenient for the user if my app could react on the nfc tag even when the phone is locked   add system tray support so that app can be minimised to system tray   you need to provide corewindow minimise api in this case   allow other formats than pcm and float for a frameoutputnode created with createframeoutputnode of class audiograph   this burden would be eliminated would mp frames be available by the frameoutputnode   other formats like mp or ogg would be nice   it must be possible to only unload main ui out of the process without terminating the app service   allow changing of volume in the windows device portal   please add the old silverlight pivot control to uwp toolkit   can you please add an iap which would have a recurring payment automatically charge user monthly annually etc   i would like to add a function that automatically loads the lyrics to the song that is played right now   to solve that it would be enough to have read access to the system media transport controls data of other apps   it could be interesting to provide a control to generate and show a power bi chart inside a uwp application easily with a control or by code   it would be useful for creating more user friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example by refreshing tile or sending notification on the event not some time after it happened   we can also change lock screen background   however it would be useful to get more flexibility   if we could put some templated or custom notifications it would save us a lot of work and make lock screen more user friendly   provide more rich api for text rendering without need to use low level direct d for rich text rendering capabilities   i d also be happy if maptilesource property changes like bounds were applied to the map without need to remove the tile source and add it back this is how it can be done currently   compare the ui usage with google chrome for example   maybe by default the way it looks now but it should have a slider that is magnified if the user taps close to edge of the list and signals its intention to use more   there is should be a way to include secure data as strings or byte remotely at dev center as app setting   there is should be way to revoke secure data on server which would require re publishing app with new set of keys and app with revoked keys should fail on access to secure storage   this data should be accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should be installed into secure key storage as part of app installation process   provide ability to deploy an update to certain users only   it would really be great if there was a control which allows to move forward an backward like the microsoft edge browser does with touch input or touchpad input   it should work like a horizontal listview or gridview so you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end of the list and continue scrolling the edge like part should kick in and navigate you to new or old view page list   i d love a control that would be a sibling to listview or gridview only it was backed by a d canvas instead of an itemsstackpanel   allow the placement of rectangular items in d   an optional bonus would be to allow the user to rotate the items   the look and content of the items should of course be customizable   it would be extremely helpful to be able to create mediasourcestreams for audio streams in the vorbis and or opus formats   dockpanel should be ported to windows xaml   currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular i e   should be clear nullable properties in xaml should be supported and not give the error cannot assign to nullable type on property   please check and fix this bug as it is causing frustration to xbox users   for me personally it would be much more convenient to be able to enter my privacy policy content directly into a text field when submitting updating my app rather than having to provide a url so i think this should be an option   allow us to use runtime arguments for windows applicationmodel fulltrustprocesslauncher launchfulltrustprocessforcurrentappasync in addition to the parameters declared in the manifest   in short you could add something like this in your manifest file   in my case i would also be happy if it was possible to add verbs on all file types but this is something i could live without   merging them into a single installer would benefit our users greatly   it seems in order to do that we need to either pull out of the store or convert our desktop app to a uwp and merge the two installers   it would be great if we have an option in disabling the overpanning behavior in scrollviewer with an api or with any other option to disable it   net standard should be used by uwp and not limited by it   because only simple values are supposed to be used as navigation parameters this suggests that a third party software component must exist for managing the sharing of complex objects between pages   evidently this is a limitation of the mediacomposition saveasync api it should be fixed   if fm radio apis are brought in it would be amazing if we could get rds support as well   i believe this should be a user based permission api in case the user doesn t want me to have this ability   i would greatly apperciate if these apis could be added to uwp   it d be fantastic if it could be possible to access such data from the converted classic apps   if my app is currently playing audio it would be nice if my app could control the experience and interact how i would want it to outside of the system experience   i would like to control have my app control the vibration haptic feedback setting   just imagine connecting your phone to a display device and building uwp apps on it it can be the next big thing for developers because no developer wants to carry a kg laptop wherever he goes   it would be cool to have a option to remove the border and caption of the window so we can make non rectangular windows just like with gdi and the layered windows api   please expose the directx com api as uwp one having the api coming from microsoft would be a much better guarantee than relying on third partys or in house wrappers   subscribers of the backrequested event should be notified in stack order instead of queue order   example in the uwp community toolkit the masterdetailsview control needs to listen to the back requested event to handle navigating back when in a collapsed state with selection   it would be great if user and dev could modify alarm volume   the best it would be if also dev could set volume granularly on each toast notification   user might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day   let the user choose between spit screen or anaglyph red cyan   the only workaround so far is to write the text in a win wpf application and then copy paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes a serious security problem when working with critical passwords   please add full ldap support query read write   making it possible for us to write tests and code once and have it being tested in an autonomous way   provide libraries to help me get started with project rome and building a cross device experience for my application   enable linux devices to be included in a user s device graph to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices   enable ios devices to be included in a user s device graph to enable discovery launching of apps and communication between connected devices   i would like to be able to have screenshots for each and every action for a winappdriver like i had with codedui via uitestactionlog html see https msdn microsoft com en us library jj aspx for what i am looking for   it would be very useful if you allow external devices e g through bluetooth to control the running audio video on the phone   please allow to set the display language of mapcontrol to one different from windows display language   music app can provide to its users an extended network functionality such as audio streaming upnp dlna or smb cifs or ftp client to get music files from server upnp dlna client to send audio data to renderer upnp dlna media server or renderer   it would be useful to have either backgroundnetwork new capability or atleast extend backgroundmediaplayback capability and if playback is active which can possibly be using network communication and app is not suspended keep network communication active   the only option for now would be to make a separate pro app   please add an azure developer vm for windows with unity   the playback devices and recording devices section should be merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should be added with a better ui   it should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels of a multichannel device if you need your average stereo output for most applications   therefore it would be nice to have an option like xsltsettings enabledocumentfunction property in net apps   please add ability to remove azure ad association   please add to manage users account level permission show notifications for disable enable this option   adding this may encourage more developers to port their apps to windows from ios and make things more familiar   please provide an api for quiet hours in windows mobile where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background   i would propose adding the ability for the splitview pane to be opened by swiping in from the left side of the screen   would it be feasible to somehow make this type of offering as part of the store   the xaml engine of uwp should manage complex types for xaml attributes   i suggest to make the xaml engine able to use an interface that lets transcode convert an instance to and from a string   allow the ability to open the explorer and show a selected file in the explorer so that the view is already scrolled to have to file visible   advanced creation tools need to implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user to select a color on the screen and use it in the application   it would be great if you could request special permission from the user like a notification manager request and that would allow the password manager to fill password forms   there would need to be some things that would probably need to be specified for that to work such as specifying a username textbox   please add few enhancements so it accepts html also or add a converter which may help developers   i suggest making this data more accessible so that servers can be better monitored both to track failures and to inform a cloud system it needs to scale out to more servers   new http server and httplistener apis should be added that surface the failures and request queue state   it would be great to add new status like closed or abandoned   please set a limit and if you are going to ask for a description make it at least or characters long   windows should allow users to freely redirect media audio midi even video someday i guess from to the hardware audio interface webcam etc and or applications even considering the desktop as a video audio media generator   it could be as simplistic as allowing piping apps devices outputs into apps devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed by the user through a piping routing manager gui   there should be a native way for developers to omit their app from being able to show a preview when hovered over in the taskbar as well as preventing the screenshot that is visible in the recent apps section on mobile   we are aware of the risk of allowing an app to hide itself from the system but it would be beneficial for security software to have a means of controlling any data that may need to be hidden   at this point i think it might be best to just lift the restriction of insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless of version   at the very least don t delete reviews from the dev center even if they re not displayed in the store so we can use them for marketing etc   why dont we support adjacenttotopdisplayedge and adjacenttobottomdisplayedge too   make it possible to add the environmentpermission node in the package appxmanifest to allow environment variables to be retrieved   add this for side loaded or enterprise distributed apps on desktop devices   set up a uwp shell app to test within   do the minimum to create an instance of a tcp service and add a text attribute with a key value pair   in addition to existing functionality which allows to collect dump when app crashes it would be nice to have an option to collect dump of running process on windows mobile any time you want via device portal   add a usernotificationchangedtriggerdetails to usernotificationchangedtrigger background task with at least   my suggestion is to change the behavior of that triggers or add another pair which will fire on lock unlock transitions   this behavior should be fixed or a new property should be made available in the sdk to enable us to get the user defined settings for regional format   we need a way to have a system wide overlay notification   this could be used in the new skype preview app and would be extremly awesome and powerful   please update torch driver for these devices we need use torch for our app s   allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look on par with desktop apps   please increase these limits maybe as an opt in   keep in mind the limits command elements in a command set listenfor entries in a command total phraselist elements and total phraselist items across all phraselists   to do so it is crucial we can remove the close button or complete titlebar from the tabtip keyboard   use file playback sample or custom effects sample   and for the consistency of the ui design sometimes it will be nice to allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button   for example developers can hide those built in buttons and draw their own ones and call corewindow minimize corewindow maximize etc   looking forward to customizable window chrome for uwp apps   an example is in vs i have files copied in during a build process and would like the ability to write against the   so please make all versions the default   can you add a new property in ocr library so that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written in   add support for ngening to the desktop bridge installation   it would be great if mediacontrol supported webm format   this property needs to be implemented for mobile as well to enable a true universal app scenario   i would like the ability in xaml to conditionally have my xaml output be compile with flags like you can currently with c#   it would be more useful to be able to sort by reviews acquisitions crashes and ratings   while this could be also a fix for roslyn system runtime csharp analyzers the generated bindings are not the owner of the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings   please add shell context menus api for uwp apps   a simple property to set and get focused item would be appreciated   so please add tcp timestamps option support to the streamsocketcontrol class   please add a way to get a storyboard is paused   what would be nice is instead of sending tile notifications for every minute if there was a way to better adjust the live tile image every minute   i d also love to see better extension entrypoint os integration similar to app v   please provide a template for dx xaml interop   once a storagefile or storagefolder is allowed to be accessed by the user it should be accessible across all those different api   it would be nice to have a command line tool to submit apps to the store   launcher launchfolderasync should accept a storagefile as first argument   it would be great to have the ability to hide all apps categories in with windows store and only have it show the private app store   it would be very useful to add this feature into hosted web apps so that native textboxes in a web application can inherit this capability when converted into a hosted web app   please fix this bug once a passwordbox with an inputscope numericpin is rendered the keyboard becomes stuck as a number pad and does not return to the full keyboard   the new notification access is awesome but is it possible to add overlay ui and services you will find it under accessibility settings in android to rs   i really want the universal apps to grow more powerful   solution when open by a file type association the at least a simple dialog should ask allow access to all those file types or to the folder or only that file   camera should work when app is minimized   the idea is to segregate the user interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute on users machine outside of browser chrome as a standalone application   make it easier to register for a background task   there are a lot of upcoming features to help with fluent design and they are really great however to make full use of these the features xaml controls need to be backward compatible or do a fallback so that apps that do not target only the latest can also use this   please review your package scanning portion of the application   developers should have the option to opt out instead of the option to opt in   having a device portal across all the different devices is a great idea   please add an api that allows to read the temperature from the device   please add an option to get rid of the fade in animation for opacity   that s why markdowntextblock could offer a way to register some kind of callback function which is called whenever the control comes across a fenced code block with a specified language id   all i m asking is when a new version of windows is released please keep the old vms still in there   in fact we can use xe d share with fonticon element without the enumeration   it would be really cool if i could open a tcp ip socket and by listening to the raw transmissions and re send events determine how good the network quality is   the other side of the task should not even expect to notify someone of its progress unless the platform offers capabilities such as sql server x event windows application event log or some form of notification   it would also be good for tracking the causes of uninstall spikes etc   it would be nice if for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size can t fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around similar to msn news live tile or calendar app but in this case an individual notification would be cycling rather than a queue of separate notifications   also it would be great to have the option for paid apps to be a subscription so users are charged periodically to continue using the app   some apps could benefit from an easy way to not only send a toast notification but also maintain a notification history users could view afterwards   implicit datatemplates not really an issue of the pivot but would be great to have these   a control similar to the flowdocumentreader flowdocumentscrollviewer would be really awesome   i ve had to take ads out of my app to make it run and stop users complaining but now that means no income until this is fixed   the control is the equivalent of a pivot table in excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations   please expose undo redo functions on the textbox control so that we can trigger it programatically   if would like to offer some guides to the user in our own application it could be interesting to have some interesting to be able to show a popup that give user some indication in the app in a precise scenario like when discovering a page the first time or when a new feature has been delivered   allow to mix two app models javascript winjs html and c# xaml inside one application   make scroll viewers and lists support gestures to scroll to bottom or to top at once   so if a menu is displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu without clicking the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open   in fact i wonder why ms does not support this fundamental feature while android and ios already does   if you create a listview in an html uwp app you can t invoke an item after scolling trough it with your touchscreen   allow the placement of rectangular items in d   make autosuggestbox supports automationproperties for test automations and accessibility   currently store access from windows is either enabled or disabled this really needs to be more granular   i think that app should have two ratings one from windows phone users visible to people having windows phone and second one from windows mobile users visible to windows users   in the appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors or a hex value   there should be an option to enter accent to let the default splashscreen have the users accent color   when using a listview bound to a collectionviewsource with grouped items it would be great to have the option to make the grouped item selectable interactive   with mouse flyout opens on right click which is ok   if i have access to the fm radio apis i need the ability in my app to force audio to go through the speakers not the headphones   i would like to programmatically set and get the volume for windows   with windows mobile uwp and continuum microsoft is focusing on enterprise customers and developers so i think bringing vs to windows mobile through continuum can be game changer   so that in theory our applications could report and find bugs for us   it should also be possible to easily select the device where you want to play your system sounds but also to select two channels   using the createrequestasync method of usercertificateenrollmentmanager and certificateenrollmentmanager classes i noticed that the certificatepropertiescollection does not give us the capability of specifying enhanced key usage oids for example smartcard logon secure e mail basic constraints like subject type end entity or path length constraint none nor the subject alternative name like rfc ds object guid ect   i hope you will take this suggestion in consideration since this feature will be very useful and easy to implement by applications developers   of course it would be even better to make xaml use typeconverter additionally for compatibility s sake with wpf   i already know workarounds using bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect a binding is not a transcoding conversion they are different by nature   this gives you low latency input in case of a busy ui thread   i think microsoft needs or boost xaml development or if it doesn t interest it open source it then the community can itself improve it   please revise that value to px or provide better representation solution   any media audio midi video generator consumer be it an app or an hardware device should be treated as a freely connectable node instead of an hardwired starting ending point like today   the documentation indicates that it should be possible to provide an environmentpermission for this to work but out of the box running this code in a uwp project never throws any of the listed exceptions if you don t specify the environmentpermission   simple usage of the dns sd api results in the dns client service crashing   extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app   it would be much like the skype for desktop s small call window that comes up when you are in a call   we d be much happier if we could just avoid defining these macros entirely to avoid any possible issues   an api that would take minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding   pedestrianfeaturesvisible cannot be disabled if mapstyle is set to aerialwithroads and cannot be enabled if is set to aerial dwithroads   i belive it s critical to make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building a refined ui   wpf apps work much better when ngen d   i liked the previous dev center where i could compare multiple apps on the same graph and just the look in general   there should be a way to define them at once   i m sure making the interface public would save a number of developers a fair amount of effort and frustration   it worked fairly well on wp but now on w m when you go to the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile   i know i can get server certificates from the server once the request is done but it should have to be done just before sending the info in the same request   please enhance launchfolderasync to accept any istorageitem file or folder as the first argument   right now we can t able to assign itemssource to mapicon in here map for universal apps please allow to bind so can have easy to implement the apps having multiple map icons loads from database   we have to provide different versions of our client application at the same time as converted app in the store   for example if in the msi appx is added folder like samples or projects it cannot be found by the open save dialogs with set initial directory opened by the installed executable even if the folder is installed in the installed executable s folder   the new notification access is awesome but is it possible to add overlay ui and services you will find it under accessibility settings in android to rs   it will make uwp more powerful like win and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps like universal copy and native clipboard   there should be an option if the busness store settings that if checked will send the updated app to the new lob apps section under manage apps   i wish that garbage collection was optional for c# uwp apps   add an easy to use and customizable ribbon control like the ones found in the office mobile apps that scales on pcs to phones   there should be a powershell prompt in device portal that lets me run extra commands   it should be possible to create visual studio centennial project in winforms wpf win mfc etc which should also allow mixing of uwp code like xaml ui with full interop between native and uwp platform   ada has the ability to express pre and post conditions and add them in an easy manner if these were to be put into the apis you could block erroneous data from being passed into the api s function which in turn should make things more stable or at least give more meaningful error messages than x f f x f xc f and the like   my suggestion is that microsoft create an cordova adcontrol and mediation plugin   we frequently need to automate tests that run as different test users so that we can test workflow etc   allow the developer to query windows store with restfull api service   would be nice to have a market place where you can buy sample starters themes and plugins from independent developers   now that microsoft has bought xamarin integrated it in visual studio and made it free it would be awesome to replace xamarin forms xaml syntax with current uwp so that devs can benefit from all the new rich features such as relativepanel x bind adaptive triggers live visual tree etc and also no learning curve for xamarin forms specific naming conventions e g stacklayout instead of stackpanel   i d like to see support for having winappdriver log to a local file as well as support for setting log levels   would be nice to have a market place of beautifully designed apps submitted by independent developers   please let me know when you will add more payment options   you could consider doing the same   on the screen select the features you want to install if i select the windows software development kit feature at the bottom it installs gb worth of stuff including headers libraries and source code   if there is no api to access this information enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting   something that would really give the mapcontrol a leg up over esri would be the ability to create a shapefile object and pass it as a parameter to something like mapelement createelementsfromshapefile shapefile and get a list of mapelements that could be added to the map   at least please provide app price conversion list between usd and local currency   think of foreign developers   it s better if we wake up early   since most of us don t have a trademark on app names this should be forced by the store everybody will benefit with this developers and microsoft with a cleaner app store   adding disqus to the windows blog would be a great way to improve developer engagement and build the windows developer community   this suggestion is for the windows blog and is asking to improve its current commenting system by replacing it with disqus https disqus com   trying to bind to a uri will either throw an exception or give a compiler error i can t remember which and certainly won t display an image   you can write your own converter for system uri to an image source type but then you have to manually specify the converter on each binding plus you lose any performance tweaks ms may have made in their own converter   it might make sense to have another method alongside requestverificationasync that allows consent verification via pin or password but there needs to be a way to request biometric only consent verification   would be great to have these bugs fixed soon   for older browser that do not fully support es the code could be transpiled into es by babeljs traceur etc   however it would be even better if it allowed users with the developer role to create app packages in visual studio   i would expect the store to be capable of searching the partial words also or may be give an advance search option where people can tell where the word should be searched   the only workaround provided by msft is to manually periodically wake up and reschedule a bunch of notifications ahead of time   if microsoft really wants to get into the iot they should really support version with ipv communication over bluetooth   start typing something in the search tab and try to scroll to the bottom most element while the inputpane is open you cant see the last element   how to you intend your surface pro users to keep the surface steady with one hand while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand   i have some great ideas and working on this since some weeks and when i tried to implement scheduling i was surprised to see that this is not available on windows   please make support for setting set automationid on corewindows and messagedialog   another even better option instead of adding the edit extensibility would be adding an open with option in the built in photos app   uwp really needs a way to handle master details situations easily maybe something like uisplitviewcontroller offered in ios sdk   this can give an app the false impression of being able to modify a non app calendar until a save is attempted and fails with unauthorized exception   seeing as splitview is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area it would make sense for splitview to allow a paneplacement top and paneplacement bottom in addition to its current left and right parameters   i would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in x pixel size   would be really helpful to have findancestor api added just like in silverlight and wpf   back to how it was on the old dashboard would be ideal just a simple link to toggle between visible and hidden   i suggest these new maximum lengths title characters description characters same as for app description   you could also consider implementing this partially for example allow inheritance only between managed winrt classes and deriving managed classes from native winrt classes   please modify like this   you cannot submit any app during this period   if you have any question please contact support   if we try to use one of those it answers with a parameter incorrect without any details   nevertheless user experience is very bad if the device state is always unknown upfront   consistency could be ruined if every dev needs to handle manual markup especially as the ui toolkit   the whiteboard app for example resizes graphic images with pinch stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios   example code which registers a service using windows dns sd apis   for example if i want to shut down or take a photo or search for dolphins or want to show the weather to the user or whatever from the uwp app itself   this way the app is very robust and flexible   this way as membership in a group changes the license assignment for app will automatically change   reason being i do my own d rendering without using directx for that video portion of my code just locking the screen directdraw surface for it s parameters   however there is no toolkit available for affinity designer which is the only design program besides adobe xd that is available in the microsoft store   the error is in error   i m okay with a friendly warning perhaps a glyph replacement   not only will this benefit both microsoft and samsung but put more power into the hands of the users and developers of both which are many many people   exactly as the title says   besides it will have a broader reach to consumers   to wrap this up i really have faith in what microsoft and doing and cortana while it needs improvement it can prove to be a great competitor that what s out in the market but being limited to few regions it just not useful and that sucks   i got several user feedback if i could provide a larger compact overlay   seems my users would prefer watching a video always on top with a larger size   currently to interact with a datagrid s rows you must specify a selectionchanged event   the wpf grid control had a showgridlines property   this property is missing in uwp   it looks that it removes something from the folder but it cannot   after a while the contents start moving but there is no way to move to the very top or very bottom using only the touchpad mousewheel   there seems to be a bug in dns sd where finished services are not actually getting unregistered   i liked windows version   i would like to try or maybe some of the rest of you have   as a developer i am constantly dropping new packages into the dev dashboard   bonus the cancel button on the upload operation doesn t appear to function either   as an early adopter of the platform i have a number of test apps and or games   some of these users are dirtbags and send me garbage feedback like asdfasdfasdf   i also created a few test groups i can t delete in the past as part of my exploration of the dashboard   the page indicates duplicate email addresses will be removed yet when i paste in duplicate email addresses they remain   press button show selected view as standalone and app is chrashing   what is the problem   i m currently using a controller mapper like xpadder and joyxoff with my xbox controller   the latest os update to the hololens is missing key features for the commercial suite such as kiosk mode and others   your recent upgrade keep killing dwm exe which it s caused display driver to died   most of us don t give a care about apple features we just want controllable situation and not wasting our time trying to delete virus that you recently given to us   no info regarding last update   when you registered with wrong account you need to contact microsoft support and cancel it and needs to signup with correct microsoft account again   allow rotation scaling of mapicons so that they stick relative to when the map is rotated   also would like to place triggers at oom levels but that is a seperate issue   it would be especially powerful and useful to be able to access the dom that is in the currently loaded page of the webview control and have full control over querying it and even modifying it if necessary   if all variations could be merged i think most developers would be able to adjust to it and there would be less confusion in the future   the best answer would be to simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages   and our customers would love to be able to install these apps without having to install firefox or chrome first   for exemple the close button could be a top right triangle or larger cube   the old format of showing up to screen shots side by side would give a user a better feel for the app as a whole   another suggestion is to add another section at the bottom showing related apps as long as they meet a certain review standard to promote cross visibility   we would prefer it either to show the app s page in the store or to not be included in the results at all if it appears to create an error   i think you should provide the option to capture audio with an external mic via the mm jack and not through a bluethooth external mic   when running a small ssd for your c drive the emulators can take up a large amount of space so it would be nice to move them to a second hard drive   please make the theme beautiful by making the icons d   instead of tiles we want something attractive for instance windows style icons more than initial screens customized task bar the action and notification center should be glass style or in customized transparency style  unfortunately the api does not support that e g it logs off account when logging into account  api uses a webview based auth  there are a lot of ms settings commands to launch different settings pages from code on hololens but there is no way to call the utilities page under the sysem settings  our primary uwp app is currently compiled as x only because there are some limitations of c libs we use  we ve discovered just today that webgl does not work in webview in uwp apps compiled as x on windows  any idea if this will be fixed in a cummulative update  when using menyflyout showat frameworkelement point with menuflyoutpresenter style with rounded corners or other semitransparency unwanted white background is shown under it in windows  this was not happening before on windows or earlier  our app is using menuflyout with shadow effect a lot so it s causing us lot of headache right now  the treeview from windows update lacks the possibility to select a ceirtain treeviewnode from code  mouse sensors and other similar harware devices  for user the sensors are the different places and ways to touch in space having xyz coordinates like  this is the second question with kind of hardware device is use to  and when you type glyphuri in the vs xaml editor and type equal sign it pops up an opinions menu to open a fonticon wizard  when you select either on it automtically adds the font to a folder under your project called fonts that you can specify using a ms appx resource path  if you open the fonticon wizard it looks similar to the old windows charmap application except it also has an extra button called manage fonts when you click it you get a font management page that lets you add new font from your harddisk download a new font from nuget etc more the document said that occurs when the user invokes the system button for close the x button in the corner of the app s title bar  but when user tapping x button on sets window https i imgur com wziitq png the event not raised correctly  because a lot of user post a bug report to the app review on the microsoft store  the launchuriforresultsasync method works fine  but we can t change the size of the window that is opened  it is always x  this prevents us from using this api  when running a uwp app on win desktop i m able to add two timedtextcues to a timedmetadatatrack with the same starttime but on mobile it results in a crash  i m guessing this is a bug because it doesn t produce an understandable exception  if i add the cues to the track before adding the track to mediasource externaltimedmetadatatracks the crash happens when adding the track  i reproduced this on mobile emulator wxga inch gb and on a lumia

will see that await loadasynctask never ends  the last three days i was working hard to solve a problem submitting our uwp app to the store  now i know why it was not working and i want to make my knowledge public  we have an uwp app targeting windows fall creators update which was published successfully to the sore previously   a new version fails the certification process with app crash or freeze  side loadable release builds are also starting and working on our build and test machines  this package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain  this package does always crash after side loading it  so this crash is not the problem reported by the certification process  now things are very complicated   the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain on the microsoft certification server which generates a package which fails at startup  the same build process on my developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds  unfortunately there are no more details available from the certification process  also microsoft support could not help me  they build a package which fails without details and i can not download the build package for debugging  the test flight certification process builds the same package internally  fortunately it does not try to start the build as part of the certification process  so i was able to install the test flight package on my local machine for debugging  and it crashed at startup  using some gflags and vs i was able to find that the entry point for formatmessage was not found   entry point for formatmessage not found after some searching i found this https github com aarnott pinvoke commit cb fd e df f fca c f eb and yes i was using this library with the old version  so the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash at startup  but why was it working on my local machine  this is because i am using visual studio which has already fixed the problem  unfortunately the build infrastructure of microsoft which is used for the uwp certification process at least for our targeted os version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version of the supportedapis x  after i used the latest version of pinvoke kernel dll which contains a workaround for the problem all was fine   the microsoft build server for submitted uwp packages is using a buggy c program files x windows kits app certification kit supportedapis x  local release builds created with the native toolchain of vs are working  here the supportedapis x  i hope this helps  maybe it will help someone  debug build of the app is starting and working on our developer machine notice datauri property and resource path ms appx pointing to svg file added to visual studio project under an svg folder  then mybutton txt can contain getting the ms appx path correct and not mistyped is a serious pain in the neck that s why microsoft should let people drag and drop them from their project tree in ms appx path format  for windowsml and machinelearning net applications we need to monitor processor usage specificly by ai processes in task manager  after a trial has expired the expiration date is set to  previously this is messy because it requires setting from c# code to measure height of font and multiply by number of lines to set textbox height from code  my approach is xaml and doesn t require messy calculations  when heightline then the height is set with height property  the default value for heightline can be set to by default to maintain backwards compatibility  not everybody cares about drawing pixels on a paper and placing everything that way line numbers is enough for a control panel type setttings page  it is not clear in what order i should check these properties to allow a user to continue  let s say i have a couple of views and their related viewmodels  the viewmodels have

anyway off the main ui for processing i don t need nor want winrt api s spawn even more threads  although the intentions of increased threading throughput are respectable focus on writing api s that

uwp app from xbox  the microsoft windows wmi activity etw provider has some updated events with new fields on windows specifically event but there may be other ones but the version field in these events has not been updated  what i think cool is getting the latlong points of visible map layer allowing me to place any useful information on the sides or corner  trackpad activities are not unified across different controls  however we can t do the same thing in map control or in photos app  it acts just like using a mousewheel with increment and it makes us feel awful  broadfilesystemaccess works when min version  picksinglefileasync and picksavefileasync functions do not work on iot they just return nothing  also phone has support but is painful to use why is it

problem with uwp listview particularly using isupportincrementalloading interface as a datasource  a few words about problem context  in our uwp app there is a listview and it uses isupportincrementalloading as a datasource  and while next part of data is loading listview is disabled  so the problem in that if you scroll listview in way you catch scrollbar and pull it to the down when you scroll to the end of the list listview will be disabled for some period of time while data is loading  and if you release mouse button from scrollbar while listview is blocked then some strange behavior of scrollbar appears after listview became enabled  you cannot hover mouse on scrollbar because when try to do it scrollbar goes upper  note i ve got success with experiencing this problem in uwp app created from scratch used listview and isupportincrementalloading  i d like to attach sample app but i don t understand how of course if it possible  note if discard of using isupportincrementalloading the problem exists but a bit another kind of  thanks in advance  unable to prevent auto close of inputpane which is creating issue due to a possible bug of inputpane in uwp with target version on tablet  for opening inputpane for nd input element you have to tap outside to lose focus then you will have to tap that input again which will focus input and will open inputpane as its focused now through tapping not by tab button of inputpane  this issue has been many times on stack overflow but its still answered  for i like that the backbutton is now built in to the navigationview control  however the placement of the button looks terrible next to the hamburger button  i was actually excited to see it was built into the nav control because i can t figure out where to place the backbutton either such that it doesn t look weird and out of place but the built in nav backbutton doesn t solve the problem either it still look weird and extreme beta  currently there s a set of com apis that provide access to virtual desktop related features like pinning apps to desktops switching desktops etc  unfortunately most of it is undocumented and does not seem to be stabilized spring update for instance changed iapplicationview s clsid so apps using it stopped working  the store listings are not editable for all my applications  graphic materials are absent everywhere  i cannot report my problems from dashboard so i do it here  use new csproj format for uwp apps   the one used in dotnet core applications windows is the only platform that doesn t support this natively  even the iphone has had this for almost eight years  i have been experiencing tons of system crashes recently so i disabling my third party loopback driver to see if it helps but this means i lose this functionality  not having these apis means i cannot as a developer make an app that uses the surface touch screen to control music software  android and ios have popular apps that do

find my log file or result and how to fix it  i can see it relative with usbxhci but i have no idea  often the same command is available in an app through different ways  it might be placed in a menuflyout in a button in a appbarbutton  the problem is that all these controls have different properties for the text content  all with the same original and translated text for all languages  it is pretty annoying having to duplicate lots or resources just becase the same command has now moved to a different control  currently you cannot create an emitter unless you are using k wave audio  back in directsound you could do l r panning with any wave sample rate  one of the benefits of migrating to audiograph is support for mp other files but if you want do panning you still have to convert them first  i am looking after a solution already over a decade for d mouses working over windows remote desktop connection  still today d mouses usb connected to the local computer and used over a

attribute for the button control it looks like and doesn t line up  that would be sort of like going to starbucks and telling the casher person to leaving room for cream in your coffee where the cream layer is for your headers  the reason why button needs a header attribute is because if i make a grid of a textbox with header field set and a place a button next to it it looks likes like without the header padding to push the button down  in the case where no bing maps data is being used e g  ideally some way to disable the bing maps access explicitly plus some smart watermark i e ms resolution  i believe there is progress coming way for this issue already but i want to post it just to show my desire for it  i am attempting to use lsof to find an open port for an application but rather it returns sock can t identify protocol  this occurs because proc net tcp is empty and thus the socket cannot be identified as tcp  i selected a set of rd party drivers and my pc immediately failed to

with it without any problem but i want to post it to see if it can be fixed for another user  how to emulate the bug  now with the mouse pointer click on the title of the window and move it to the

filesavepicker with uwp even if the application adds different choices with the same file extension then it is not possible to know which of those choices the user actually selected  filesavepicker just returns a storagefile class for the file name and extension  issue i developed a desktop application saving files with different formats with the same file extension using savefiledialog and filterindex and currently uwp would not allow me to convert the application from desktop without adding additional menu options or dialogs so the user can chose what he she wants  this means adding more steps to select something that is already shown on the filesavepicker dialog which i think it would eventually affect in a way the user experience   scenario an application saving different file

the other developers try to force customers to use their software for example m with edge and paint d  m even tries to pay customers to use bing edge  if necessary you could send your incompetent product managers to the competitors at least at school so the can learn how great software has to feel and look like  m just displays lines  it feels like m is begging the customers to send no feedback because m hates it but must do something  this is the crezy idea  m could try again to develop great software again as many years before which your customers want to install themselves because it s just fun to work with and it brings great benefits to users  how about letting the user decide whether my people should use these animated notifications or normal toasts  i m missing the ability to change the font name size and color  i m not a developer  i m a school teacher  i am considering future options for puchasing devices  there doesnt seem to be any website for this  i understand that cloudbooks are meant to largely be web based tools  but there are still times when you want to install some things  i also understand that this will be something that software manufacturers will be requesting to ms directly  with f# still not providing a way to code a full application for the desktop using uwp after several years of people waiting i want to call for bringing common lisp to the platform  machines now have the power to really make lisp shine and show all it can do to empower uwp developers to create amazing solutions  the users that are already subscribed to the add on will keep the same price as before but the new users will get the new price  what s the reason that currently microsoft is blocking a price increase  it s not really convenient for developers to create every time a new add on when they want to increase the price  we tried to embrace microsoft s vision for uwp but failed misreably wasting lots of time and money  we built a uwp application that reads public data off iso smart cards successfully until we realized that the app fails to function in release mode  in debug mode it all works fine  in release mode we generate the appx and it passes windows certification  the smartcard functionality however which is based on a net standard library fails to work https github com danm de pcsc sharp  we are now trying to use the native uwp smartcard api but its largely useless as we cannot find any methods to construct and transmit apdu which are the basic communication block for now we have no option but to re build the app to a non microsoft environment  the wireless card worked well till windows  now this is a mess  intel says they cannot give update  i have to do it whenever there is some heavy thing

isolation and hyper v isolation for containers are available in windows server but windows only supports hyper v isolation  hyper v isolation has benefits but also has many drawbacks such as resource

the propertyname and the control type at least  something that lets you investigate  using microsoft gift cards as developer account registration fee  well it s really powerful for indie devs let s say there is a app which display news stories  the app does not want to have too many stories on the screen and load stories on demand  the first time the app is opened it downloads news article and display s say the top to user in a listview and rest are stored locally  these are displayed if the user scrolls down incremental loading collection helpers are great addition  now let s say next day the app is opened again  app immediately displays yesterday s news stories and works in background to load new stories or user pulls to refresh  as soon as new stories are downloaded they are added at the from of the listview not all but say top and rest goes to the disk cache  now if user scrolls down more stories are fetched from the cache disk  on windows uwp apps if you rapidly click or unintentionally double click on any control supporting click tapped event its associated click event handler will execute for each  this can cause a lot of unintended side effects  for example if the click event handler brings up a modal contentdialog with the showasync command an additional click will cause the event handler to fire again before modal isolation occurs and create another contentdialog which causes an exception if not handled will result in a crash of the application  tablet version microsoft windows version  target version windows build  it used to do this in windows and early windows versions but this apparently changed a while ago  this will be a good addition  it is understandable that when uwp app is run normally it can only access a limited set of com objects however if the uwp is packaged to desktop bridge it makes sense to allow it to access additional com objects exposed by that desktop bridge using the technical described in the blog above  without this support if a desktop bridge contains a uwp app and a win app exposes out of proc com objects the only way uwp app can communicate with the win app is through appservice  this brings a lot of overhead and unnecessary work to add appservice into win app and sometimes it is impossible if win source code is not available  packaged com https blogs windows com buildingapps com server ole document support desktop bridge #kgekwjewfmowuzrb allows exposing out of proc com objects using desktop bridge however these com objects are not accessible from uwp apps even if the uwp apps are packaged into same desktop bridge exposes the com objects  we are a dev house that specialises in publishing dedicated xbox apps  it used to be that there was a really high standard to get certified on xbox which was tough to get through but at least the standard of apps was pretty high  now it seems there is zero standard to be certified to publish an app on xbox and by default every windows app that is published is published on all devices  i know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device but it means that when we publish an app now our app is barely out a day and it is pushed way down the new apps list making it almost impossible to generate organic downloads from curious users  that is fine if we are being kept out by other xbox apps but we released an app last week and currently there are about dozens apps ahead of us half that won t even work on an xbox with a controller  it is totally crazy and really counterproductive to building any kind of a vibrant ecosystem  one simple example is there is a pdf database app on the new apps list on xbox  you cannot use it it cannot access files and it has absolutely no viable function on xbox one  yet somehow this passes certification and is thrown on the pile of rubbish that now clutters the new app section  it is hugely frustrating to put months of work into building an app for xbox and stand no chance of getting it downloaded because nobody will ever be able to find it  i know microsoft is trying to flesh out the app stores on each device currently desktop bridge supports in app purchases  as of now there is no good ad network for existing desktop applications  this feature is almost available in any web based video player or any desktop based video player the feature is simple  when a mediaplayerelement is playing or paused a video  and the user hover overs the seekbar with mouse or pen or any other input device for that perspective wherver is the user mouse show a small thumbnail of the video file at that specific position just above the seekbar slider and as the user moves the mouse along the seekbar the thumbnail should update accordingly  i m aware of the sandboxing  in uwp applications with the codegeneration manifest capability allow the use of the existing exception table apis currently marked desktop only  on uwp for x arm and arm it s not possible to comply with the windows abi when generating code at runtime because you cannot generate the mandatory exception table data for the dynamically generated code  otherwise this function is useful to runtime code generation  so i uninstalled kb became build  re try desktop app converter was successes  i think that it is the problem of baseimage and kb  of course version build can use the dac  currently microsoft store under windows shows three types of information  but there s no numerical value representing the amount of data that will have to be downloaded  please fix this annoying issue  many applications need only desktop support  uwp is too safe so as to be impractical for so many desktop apps and wpf is like a third class citizen with microsoft in the background cheering upgrade to uwp  the sandbox nonsense has to go  let them install it if they so choose   of the applications they install aren t and won t be sandboxed uwp applications anyway  but it is not available by default  im using file explorer but if can seee my otler drives like d drive ore e drive ts gona be more handfull calcbinding is an advanced binding markup extension that allows you to write calculated binding expressions in xaml without custom converters  calcbinding can automatically perform bool to visibility conversion inverse your expression and more  calcbinding makes binding expressions shorter and more user friendly  this is only available for wpf https github com alex calcbinding here are some examples right now it s possible to define apps for websites using app uri handlers  these excludepaths feature supports only path matching right now not wildcards for the whole uri  uwp combobox is not showing the selected value under certain resolutions  in visual studio if i select the container a grid and change something like the flow from horizontal to vertical the redraw fixes the issue which leads me to believe that it s the render  we use the create date on log files to check if they can be deleted  the problem is that when we delete that file and recreate it same filename the create date stays the same  how to reproduce  it creates a test log file  run the code again  the test log file is created again  check the create on the test log it still has the create date from the first time you ran the code  run this as many times as you like the create date will not change from the first time you ran the code  it deletes the file  having sock seqpacket would remove the burden of distinguishing between independent messages from the user  it also allows greater compatibility for existing posix compatible applications as was the original goal for implementing af unix  this would be comparable to the message mode of windows named pipes making af unix sockets a more complete replacement  some users certainly will find this useful  sadly if you re someone who finds this annoying there s no option to disable this behavior  according to the singular post i was able to find on this new feature https answers microsoft com en us insider forum insider wintp insider desktop programs autostart after boot in windows dd d e b d dd d ab page auth there is no way to disable this  the new fall creators update seems to have introduced a feature where if a user reboots the system any applications that were open well some at least it seems as though to make this issue even more confusing not all applications follow this convention will automatically launch on reboot  others may find this annoying  it currently only supports octet stream  in trying to use sha timestamp current microsoft guidelines servers the powershell cmdlet set authenticodesignature fails to apply the timestamp  this cmdlet uses the cryptuiwiz api  here s the sample script to reproduce the error actually we can t because the same notification would be send too if the user is closing the application  this issue was reported for visual studio feedback site but they have determined that this issue belongs to universal windows platform  currently we have no notifying system to the developers when the customer add new feedback to the feedback hub  it s tooo painful  is it possible to add the notification system  uservoice already have it  it s a control carryover from as far back as w w linux mac system systems have never had this issue create a new blank uwp application and add this xaml code  when i run this i expect to get no suggestions in the software keyboard when writing anything in the text box  this works as expected on phones but not on computers tablets  i m using fall creators update not sure how it behaves in other versions  in my case i m writing an app where you learn how to spell and don t want to give the user any hints  we are developing components on linux which has dedicated system call and memory requests  this would signify communication and access on the file system  i have some more feature recommendations regarding extensions in adaptivegridview if you will  and which operator to use and or in case of multiple property filter provided  and this grouping will obviously include the semantic zoom feature as well  incremental loading i know this is already in the community toolkit  sorting sorting with or more properties  list gridswitcher there can be a toggle button on the top of the control which can toggle the control to view as a listview each item expanded fully or to a gridview normal grid like behaviour  these are some of the most common scenarios which are required by developers and there are many ways to do it but this can get very complicated to align them with best practices  this can be a very powerful control page yet looking very good to the eye as well  this search bar auto filters the items on basis of the filterdescriptor provided filter descriptor can be defined by the developer tht which stringtimeint property to match with which condition i e contains startswith endswith e t c  i have used unity uwp to develop lob application that visualizes d data from opened files  we also use multiple top level windows that are already available  now client wants to allow opening and visualizing multiple files which would have been easy with win just launch another instance  i have a disk imaging which i have already converted application that writes bytes directly to disk usb and sd cards  the app gets rejected during submission to the store as some features are disabled as admin privileges are required  so in a round about way you re actually raising the chances of users getting viruses by blocking these apps as they just get them from the web instead  current clipboard api can notify about a clipboard content change which is fine  this limitation results in a bad user experience because there are scenarios where the user is working with one application and another application performs some operations based on the copied content  but getting or setting the content doesn t work if the app is in background or unfocused  or the other way around where one application creates data and sets the content automatically and the user can directly use it inside another application  currently the input will be validated if the focus of the textbox lost  i can verify that this works  but unfortunately it is not possible to create a mediastreamsample from d d surface  this will allow us to do full hardware accelerated video decoding  x bind is great and i love it   this limit appears to be arbitrary and not on par with other platforms ios android mac osx  this limitation is a contribution to a diminished user experience and developer experience when compared to these other platforms  this idea is so bad on so many levels  so what is the suggestion  as a xamarin forms developer i had to drill down frameworks to find this limitation  as bad as the android docs are they at least make an effort to publish limits   do not suggest a steam roller as a work around to a shortcoming in a fly swatter  especially if that steam roller is riddled with security issues and complexity way beyond the experience and latitude of most fly swatter users  in this https social msdn microsoft com forums sqlserver en us a cc b b e d f ad b uwp c emailmanager message body getting truncated forum wpdevelop prof required following forum post the character limit for an email body generated via code from an app is noted  contentdialog is currently far too difficult to use for two reasons locking and placement  since only one contentdialog can be shown at a time a lock is needed such as semaphoreslim or a sequential queue of taskcompletionsource  in other words the class is not complete because normal use of it requires wrapping it in additional code  this means that contentdialog showasync will wait until any currently displayed contentdialog is dismissed before showing the new dialog  if showasync or showasync contentdialogplacement popup is used then the location of the dialog is not well controlled  on the other hand if showasync contentdialogplacement inplace is used then a it is not convenient because one must separately embed the dialog in xaml and b it doesn t always work because an exception occurs if showasync inplace is called on the dialog before the xaml is fully loaded  for example an error dialog that is required early during program startup cannot be shown based on a copy embedded in xaml   in addition per above a lock of some kind is needed  currently when the last element s of the tile doesn t fit because of users with unusual scaling settings for example it get s discarded out of view which is understandable  it also helps with dealing with the scenario where because of the users scaling settings there is too much space on the tile where the developer could have shown extra info  passwordvault findallbyresource throws a comexception when there are no credentials for the resource or maybe only when there are no credentials  it should return an empty list without throwing an exception  right now the window closed event for desktop fires both for minimization and for closing events  i understand this is done because of the multiplatform support but it just makes desktop apps with multiple windows harder o manage so please  a good web example can be found here https material angular io components chips overview we are able to download previous versions of the release versions of the windows sdk  on the slow ring we are currently on windows build but the only sdk download link provided on the windows insider download page is for at time of writing  i am not willing to go to fast ring because this renders my laptop useless  when you invoke the primary or secondary buttons in a contentdialog you are not losing focus in the control that was last being edited  if you are using x bind to bind that control s value to a property in the contentdialog code behind page then when you press the primary button the property doesn t get updated  i ve tried forcing the control in this case a textbox to lose focus programmatically in the primary buttonevent handler but this does not help  ive also tried bindings update bit this does not help either  the expected behaviour is that when you click on the primary i can t register dev account because of living in republic of moldova  there are thousands of programmists here too  currently there does not appear to be a way to set a window s startup position left top width right height bottom beyond full screen and or maximized  also the last used position for a given window isn t saved intrinsically  windows launch at random places on the desktop  i understand this need does not really exist for mobile  but for many desktop applications specifically container applications managing windows is a core feature objective  it is similar like this issue http www dcfever com cameras specification php id  we ve inherit a control from slider and put it in horizontal  if windows set to dpi and when slider value is the same as its maximum value  our app would crash  if we use application executablepath when the user open the shortcut he gets an access permission error so i m trying to create it using shell appsfolder but i can t get the appusermodelid i m on a desktopbridge app and when i try to use windows applicationmodel appinfo its null setting protextedtext to on doesn t work the selected text is still modifiable  editor is the value of x name given to richeditbox element  rotatortile s behavior is like an automated flipview  microsoft has added in the camera app the panorama mode which works in some devices and tablets  don t know if it is a specific number of devices that currently this feature works  is this possible to use this feature in our windows app store universal apps and if we can do we have any sample code to accomplish this  don t want a solution with the scrollviewer and the compass because i have already done that  the app list should be in grid style and background should be customized  the keyborad should also be customized like the gadget comfort on screen keyboard in windows desktop  please allow us to maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata in a git repository and simply push to a git remote to upload  instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly  what i would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app  and put it onto the description field for japanese for example for my app i have it in about language country descriptions which is a big task to handle  the user could then review the translations as best as they could  and if microsoft couldn t translate it it could just copy over the original text  that would take your default language description and fields and then use microsoft s translator to translate all the fields to the language  please add support c cx extension and type system for desktop platform  and it s good if it will be work on windows too  please comment and document this behavior therefore i want to request adding of some improvements in winrt api to bring frame s behavior closer to it s analog from wp silverlight  so would be great if microsoft things in this way also  it should be typed as it is typed in gujarati  it would be great to have a background trigger when that data was changed on another device  it is great that we can schedule tile updates so that i can always show the latest timings on the tile itself but i would love it if i could do the same thing with badges  attempting to use textalignment within page resources and referencing it via staticresource in a universal windows app will compile but throw an exception  when cortana has an expression that it doesn t understand based on the available expressions registered but cortana does recognize an app name it would be great if the user s expression was fed to the app account on the store for the developer to review and consider supporting in the future  window should stay the size i left it  please add can api to be included in the windows devices  companies like cshtml http cshtml com and duocode http duoco de are already doing this but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the microsoft universal windows platform  a mechanism that operates like phonegap cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware apis can be achieved  a bonus would be to be able to set a link for all users incl net api preferred at least win api hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots  my thought using simulator while on a page a one click button that automatically take one screenshot for each language the app supports  in the upload website a way to remove all screenshots and a way to upload all assets for all languages at once  developers should be able to make custom lockscreen app  it is very important that we support beta for both windows phone and windows  allow users of paint to select parts of images on an image they re drawing or editing diagonally other than only horizontally vertically  you could even make it possible to select the angle at which you select a certain part of the image manually and this would certainly make editing in paint a lot easier  please provide the ability to the developer to change the color of the keyboard inside their app  now this may not be so bad in english which has relatively short words but languages like german or danish make heavy use of compound words  words can get very long and thus hyphenation is needed especially on small screens  this would also bring feature parity with html js apps which already more api to detect incoming call and number so it can be blocked if not necessary and also can ring even in silent if it is important  it would be great to have the option for creating publisher s shared roaming folder as well  open sideloading for everyone  it would be better if this file was in json format and followed the manifest for web application standard from w c http www w org tr appmanifest  allow changing country and publisher name after registration on the store please either extend the existing class to consider the use cases for the phone or ditch it and come up with something more like apple s approach which works better than what s currently there  unfortunately this means the app is a none starter because the files can be several gigabytes in size so it kills the user experience everytime they try to open a file  the emulator should support sensorsdk i propose you add a proper unit test suite for the winjs platform that can be automated and ideally run from common javascript tools like grunt  please document how transitions work and expose the necessary api for us to create our own drop in replacements for the limited set of transitions supplied by the existing apis  for example on wp if i want to use a custom transition i can fake the transition by using animations at the exit and entry to a page but in order for this to work i need to remove the existing stack of transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame s collection  at the very least we need a no op transition that can be used to prevent the frame s stack from using the last transition to animate the page change  this feature is to ask for xaml serialization featureset parity with wpf system xaml  it could be better to have search box in windows phone application instead of having it in windows application alone  auto focusing the input element in page ready is not working in windows mobile application  as a developer i should have access to the entire winrt api if i am building an app for my own personal device  perhaps more developers would build for windows if they can build their own tools for personal use without so many restrictions  this is an excellent feature but i would love to see the same tools and support available for the shared project in a universal winjs app  it would be great to use bower to install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies of the same script into the windows project and the windows phone project  it makes sense to disallow universal c# xaml apps installing packages to the shared project because they might only target windows or only target windows phone  therefore there should be no problem with installing scripts directly to the shared project using bower instead of installing two copies of the same script to two different projects  it would make sense i think that en no region language will be used as a fallback for all en countries if there is no en region specified  please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back end systems  also we need a supplementary fix to the issues faced by existing affected users without resorting them to contacting microsoft customer support to restore their purchase by way of adding credit to re purchase the app  if you add more than a few like the performance is so bad that you have to wait for a few seconds after you stop to be sure that the pins controls are in the right position  either use the identity version throughout the store and let us change that with the visual studio wizard or ensure that the dev center reads the package version rather than identity version  visual studio s create package wizard allows one to assign a version number however this assigns the package version number  i would like some way so that i can have my various devices each with different form factor get the latest build deployed to them all or a select number of them instead of debugging simply failing  pubcenter users should be able to decide how much they want to receive when they get a payment  it would be great if i could decide to receive less money in a single payment and keep the rest for the next year  expose an api that allows apps aside phone and messaging to trigger person reminders  polish your new contact manager api to get the maximum performance hence the user not to sit idle till it loads  it may be based on number only contacts contacts with email address or filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc  please consider my suggestion on this case please provide a simpler example with a clearer coding  i think it is good to explain what is default image  please provide support for adding developer user id to windows developer account  hope that microsoft if possible allow us individuals to create individual developer account for free and allowed only to publish one app on windows phone or windows store  please add a link to https dev windowsphone com en us account summary that links to the password change page at https dev windowsphone com  also add the same live profile password change link to the windows store profile  might be nice to make it easier to find the right password change page  allow background services to display controls on top of other applications  it would be great to for example play a video in a small square box while browsing the web or respond to messages without having to open a message app  please support m u live streamings please please please expand the email signature function so that you are able to include a detailed signature including embeded images  by using the fileopenpicker class we can filter shown files by extensi n but i think we should also be able to filter files by their name let s say i only want to show pictures whose name start with abcd or whose name ends with bcd  so please provide this option  the dev team should be able to access info through the dashboard  make net available on all platforms including mac linux all smartphones  microsoft could have created more tools for integrating nhibernate easily into net apps but they developed entityframework instead more just like in winrt could we have spell checking options and text prediction in window phone silverlight apps  i was working on clipboard manager application for windows and discovered that there is no way to catch clipboard contentchanged event when application is running in background seems the life cycle of winrt app doesn t allow this  wish i would have a possibility to create a background task that is triggered by clipboard content changed system event  add webp support so i can easily process and export images using the format  we want access to every camera available at same tima  i think there should be a property maybe something like showdeletebutton that allows you to specify whether the delete button is displayed  a b testing is crucial for quantitative marketing  i d like to see the ability to re order my related apps so i can choose which related apps get promoted first to users  let the local apps install without need to access to windows phone store just like exe files in windows  after profiling the app i found that after calling mediacapture capturephototostoragefileasync method memory is not released and allocates mb with each call  i ve also voted for this suggestion as that could fix most of camera related issues on windows phone  the only way to detect it is by looking for unauthorizedexception but that exception is ambiguous  a location permission dialog may be showing when a network error occurs in an unrelated part of the code for example  perhaps ensuring a year gap between signups would be enough of a deterrent to those that may want to maliciously close their account regularly  please include my country yemen in pay out and advertisement too  datepicker should be allowed to have a null value initially and not a programmatically set that could accidentally be mistake for a user s input  setting dayvisible to false prevents the spinner from showing which is nice but then the date is displayed when the value is shown in the field which sort of negates the feature  it would be nice if an app could provide its own tasks todos to the os  i do alot of copying and pasting and would really like to see a customized copy and paste built into windows  that way when i paste i still have the other files in memory to paste elsewhere  if i can copy like say different files folders it would be nice to have a selection when i right click and place my mouse over paste i would like to see a paste all paste select which would have check boxes on each folder file i have selected to copy  please provide apis and support of ibeacons technology and also ble scanning without pairing just like using advertising package so that we can exchange data to or from target device  replace most used tags attributes with number  all the developers needs to do is some thing like this  if you think about productivity this is not a way to do it  allow changing the country and name after registration on windows phone store pubcenter and windows store  pubcenter ads should not play sound unless clicked on or have a way to mute ad sounds  allow developers to add suggestions to the user s wordflow keyboard  you might throw up a messagedialog in the catch clause  it would be nice to have a showforasyncaction method or something so that you have one call and don t have to worry about cleanup  it would be nice to have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each  developers need to write additional code using the deprecated directinput api to access those devices even though microsoft states that use of directinput should be avoided and xinput used instead for any gamepad functionality  there should be an update to xinput api that will add functions so to migrate and simplify that functionality from directinput  you should also be able to undelete an app package for hours after you delete  you should also be able make a backup of this information so if it does get delete you can always restore it  for the testcase source code see below  you should officially support windows template library wtl and make it the first class native windows api framework replacing the aging mfc  please release compiler sdk and tools for developing traditional desktop windows api and mfc and net application on arm windows rt devices  this capability is needed for third party apps also  now since cortana does this already please pass us the parsed nlp string with identified pronouns with grammatical breakdown  all localization should work like resw files work if there is no entry in the app description you should revert to the original entry  it would be great if windows phone will support access to contact s groups  allow a frame by frame capture from mediacapture so that developers can more easily create streaming protocols without having to relay on the ugly and poorly documented media foundation api for trivial tasks  i had unlucky case that my app was refused by the tester though on his screenshot you can see that he got exact message on why the app is not working as it required proper text to speech to be installed  bring back support for ipx spx or at the very least provide compatible drivers either through the microsoft website or as a legacy feature that can be installed on windows  currently need to generate a bitmap image which not works well for list etc additional payment option such as paypal should be added to allow people who owns visa card with advance features t register for dev center  everything works well the button is visible and it says choose file however if you click the button nothing happens  please vote here to enable photo upload option in webview apps for windows phone suggestion introduce a system with trusted developers who can release apps as quick and easy as it is now  please create properties for disable scrolling pan and zoom and auto ressizing the webview  i d like to see windows api s command prompts file explorer support a much longer file path  i feel that it is important to be able to minimize the commandbar in windows phone apps because there is limited screenspace so even something like the commandbar can make a difference  i like the ability for apps to connect to the people hub and show items in the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying to consumers and could be solved with a few apis  i suggest some apis for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the people hub   it is cool that the facebook app can show my news feed in the people hub but it s annoying the fact i have to go to the facebook app to do something  i suggest some apis for the app to attach some actions or commands to the item that the user can invoke straight from the more we need a background task system event to update the wide tile and the lock screen message when the device wakes up the lock screen becomes visible on windows phone universal apps  visual studio should allow built in gpu programming for major brands nvidia amd and intel  i think the credentials needs to be deleted with the app uninstall  i would like to have an option to buy an app or a game and send it to my friend as a gift like i do on steam  please extend this to be the maximum time that the bluetooth spec allows between pings to maintain a connection which is seconds or atleast make it greater than seconds so that very low power bluetooth devices can be made  microsoft should include a good ui for the dashboard and to make some arrangement to display total downloads in the main page like that of google android dashboardthe windows developer dashboard is simply boring stuff i d love to have better and improved reports to improve my app and tune the descriptions of my app store listings aso  for this i hope you could add the uninstall rate usage how often how long a user uses my app etc  either allow to set a different password or remove the password of it like it was before in wp  show download percentage please add a feature allowing developers to know the amount of remaining submission credits  it would also be nice if we could request those credits from the dev center i also suggest that voice to text be allowed to write this there should be a windows tool to convert android xliff strings to resx format within the windows phone sdk with support for mcc codes enable cortana on wp  press the search key and enter cortana s notebook by pressing the icon in the upper left corner of the screen  allow more specific queries on appointments  platform should support new applications that are not big companies  also i d like the rating of the app to allow me as the developer to respond back to the end user ideally emailing them and or posting it online and allow them to correspond with me to try and resolve any issues whether that is with microsoft being a proxy or whatever makes sense  i suggest to create another option that alternates lost of signal and bad signal  create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time  a an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it  well i think that the devcenter app should be updated extended so that the app can show the windows store apps as well as the phone apps which it currently does ideally it should also use the live tiles to show the current stats on your apps  suggestion show exactly that error message in the windows store dashboard  a single line should go through all the months regardless of the release or at least we should be able to turn that filter on or off  please send more information on app before removal of suspension  i am asking whoever checks or tests it put more information of their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like or  when utilizing the file picker and specifying one or more extensions the dialog that gets shown to the user should filter to these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable  let people inherit from easingfunctionbase because microsoft you do not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list of easing functions you give everyone doesn t have the one i need  please expand your search range to at least the top apps  please update the windows sdk and windows app certification kit to allow us to use win prefetchvirtualmemory function http msdn microsoft com en us library windows desktop hh v vs aspx i think that having and iap price point of could be wildly attractive to end users and get more purchases for developers  i d like to be able to ping for nearby devices running an app using peerffinder but while the app is not in the foreground  would it be practical to make it so that a user could authorize proximity tracking in the background so that an app could utilize it  make possible to add a range of list mapicon to make it faster and optimized provide computer vision apis that would allow developers to get access to functions such as motion tracking facial gesture voice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc  pivot and panorama controls should have options to enable disable wrapping  also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect  please cant we have an option in the wpappmanifest file to untick fast resume and allow wp apps to not run in fast resume mode just like in wp  microsoft should provide a better beta program for developers and user like the one in android in which you don t have to download a separate app you update the stable one to the beta in the store  allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy  it will be useful if we can set the reminder tone to vibrate so that not every reminder would beep when you re in a meeting  at times you may want to set a reminder and let it vibrate in your pocket still giving only you a notification instead of beeping out loud when you don t want it to  for one of our products we need to support nfc card reading writing with existing devices and several types of cards mifare ul ulc calypso desfire maybe even more  vs could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes pages and user controls from the original project  please add recent places to suggestedstartlocation in fileopenpicker api  it would be much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of windows windows phone  please implement the httplistener class so that we can run rest based controls similar to xbox smartglass for our own apps  let normal http uris to be able to send notifications to the app using the window external notify and not only the https uris  give the power to the developer to decide if a page is allowed to use the scriptnotify event or not  and my only wish is to format a datetime like the user wants to see it  please give us ability to run background agent and collect name of the current application in foreground  could you please add programmiatic printing to the winrt api  under wpf it is possible to initiate printing to the default printer by simply calling print on a properly configured printdocument object  in order to print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog  while this is possible with compositionsurface i feel it is needed on the image control as well  the lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from tile attributes  could you please have a report that includes the prices before the final payment  we need more control over the device so childrens activities can be regulated  once your app activates this mode users will not be able to see notifications access other apps or return to the home screen until your app exits the mode  make necessary conditions so that developers choose proper representing application high quality images as application symbols in store matching modern ui it would be good if we can at least optionally reduce the speed of the emulator to better reproduce real world devices  technically everything went smoothly but when i tried to submit the update it required that i reserved a name  please provide access to calendar api to customize the day styles basing upon requirement i d like a way to access the deviceextendedproperties specifically the anid in a windows store app  everything is fine up until that point but if you want to serialize that class so that you can store it and load it directly instead of traversing the filesystem and opening up each file to read its id tags every time you open the app which can be a lot of unnecessary work especially for larger libraries or so you can send which book to play to an audio background task you really don t have many options  my proposal is an api out of storagefolder to retrieve a storageitem given a relative path from that storagefolder  my suggestion is that when a payment is being processed this should be indicated on the financial report which include the expected date it will arrive and the exact amount being processed  i would suggest you look into admob adsense reporting for inspiration as it s very convenience and everything a developer want to know about payments is easily accessible  it would be nice to have such an api in winrt so we don t have to resort to native directx each time we need something more than a couple of shapes  what i want is the ability to record those alongside system provided etw events so that i can see how my code s activity fits in with system behaviour  i would like to have better access to lockscreen so that i can completely customize it which includes how the time is displayed any custom content like photos or news wallpaper  it should also allow a timer based updation  obviously there should probably be a pin requirement for first use set up trust but the nfc capabilities of the wp platform will never be fully realized until a simple tap can make something happen without user interference  i think this is a bug because i think if the writeablebitmap decides to update the pixelwidth and pixelheight property it should also update the pixelbuffer or the data is inconsistent  make multitasking a real thing like seeing a video or having a mini calc when browse some thing  live tiles are fine but we need a true way to make tiles more dynamic and that would be accomplished with a widget application template  in a similar way to the new lock screen apps allow developers to create an app that runs inside a tile of larger dimensions that then current pre defined tile sizes  the app should have full access to touch events on the tile so it can respond to them  allow apps to act as data sources for other apps  build on wcf to allow on phone app to app communication  allow json and or xml to pass data between apps  make apps request permission the first time they talk to a new app then let it happen in the background  we need io brokers to enable copy and paste scenarios in universal app in phone and tablet  we need real background download broker so we can have torrent or custom download scenarios some of them may not apply to specific form factor  we need windows phone to synchronize its clock via the internet  include an api to add remove deactivate tracking protection lists tpl to further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having a sense of control  it is better if developers can start their app from background i mean one develops an app that has permission to start itself when it receives a notification  i understand power consumption is a consideration but a more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system is plugged in and or giving users clear indications such activity is occurring liek android does in its notification bar so that they know why battery life is being impacted would make the winrt environment much more useful and in turn drive adoption  it would be great for a permanently running app to have an api which notifies it when an update is available to notify when an update is forced to permit the app to check for an update easily and also to permit the app execute the update  would become even more useful if say i could share to reading list from chrome extension or mac desktop or ios  we need the pivotviewer control for wpf and winrt please  i think that a wise addition would be to create a universal search platform that when enabled a single tap on the search button will bring up only a search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app and by content i m talking specifically for app content  if i use this xaml definition it work but the groupheader is not wide as the listview  with maxnumberofcolums you can limit the number of columns  win applications need to be more productive for businesses  allow xaml winrt apps to change the lock screen background  it would be much more comfortable to be able to read the entire notification in the center of notifications for wp  be responsible and give more specific details why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things  as with css it would be very useful if we could set text based framework elements to be uppercase lowercase title case etc with a texttransform property in xaml  please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account  the point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls  please allow windows phone file folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist  also please allow onedrive folder to be stored locally like winrt  because of windows and windows phone universal app i am hoping to adapt the app to windows phone as well  make sd boot fresh each time phone is restarted or double files with nothing in them to play then error  prompt all users with a warning that they should make sure that the vpn is disabled before proceeding including most users who have not enabled a vpn in the first place and popping such a message almost every time the app is launched  re write large portions of code as native code and use the winsock apis instead of the winrt  make bing vision lens in the camera app pinnable to start for quick access again and or add it to the cortana screen to the left of the music search button perhaps  please add the from to options right after download new email under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails  the online media extensibility is fantastic however it would be better if you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos  it would be good if there was more sorting either via the photo hub or via code which allows all items to be sorted title creation timestamp last updated timestamp ascending descending  pleas allow in the wmappmanifest a selection box to force legacy resume mode so my wp app can function just as it did in wp  however there should be more of swipe gestures than the tap methods  to set a difference a swipe to the right should launch settings menu as a swipe to the left launches the apps list  plesae implement windows applicationmodel suspendingdeferral as idisposable probably already declared in isuspendingdeferral and call method complete from within idisposable dispose to simplify its usage  hey i thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their internet explorer for their wp like they would on a desktop pc im apps could have custom keyboards or more fun ways of inputting data could be used  for security reasons i d really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete s the resized photo from the phone  when you connect an iphone to a mac you can view the webview from safari by going to develop debug  with frameworks like angular node jquery etc becoming more popular we really need means to debug our apps to provide the best web experience  i would like to be able to pull in bing news search results for a specified keyword android has third party apps that can block your apps games with a password  i would like to get short videos in fullscreen instead of picture on lockscreen  i hope you like the idea i bet many people would like to have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc on their lockscreen  therefore if you want to detect horizontal swipe manipulations in a vertical scrolling scrollviewer for a custom listview item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example it simply cannot be done  in my opinion it is essential to have true multi touch support for standard controls at least in universal applications  please extend song class with more useful properties such as lastplayeddate addeddate  but why not allow it to be used locally by sideloading or through the emulators  it would be great if you would add a remoteid to the calendars  i think there should be a casual genre section as a lot of apps don t fall into any specific section already listed  for example timer and alarm apps  it would be nice if more recent reviews would have more weight in the total score of the app  please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back  it would be nice to be able to render xaml that is not on the visual tree and perhaps in a background task  we should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing  for some reason entering a number with a at the front in to the dialler task in an app in wp wp or wp results in the message please enter service codes directly from the phone s keypad  it would be helpful to be able to launch the calendar for a specific day i e i tell the user you have x appointments today would you like to review them  it would be cool to allow the applicationbar to have more icons available  it would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page so you could specify one at the top left bottom or right  when will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone  it would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage or similar  please enable removing language code from the dev center language history it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history or an option to completly replace fully replace the prevoius es xap s  getting the geolocator to actually do something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting of properties correct and then attaching event handlers it would be extremely helpful if the reminder alarm api supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week  the trial feature should be built in with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just as it is in the windows store  contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode in the store but has to manually track the number of days since install whether the user has purchased etc  when submitting an app the store submission process should prompt you to link to documentation for any uri schemes your app includes in the manifest file or mark them as private uris if you don t want to document them  currently the best place to find documentation for uri schemes is the nokia dev wiki http bit ly nokiaurischemes but this information should really be available though microsoft  above could save hours spent on reading wrong answers there need to be a business app settings launcher native in the api  there must be a way to handle this kind of problem like statistics on how many times an app was started or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps  currently as of when there is an embedded video in a webview and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands to only the extents of the webview which isn t fullscreen if the webview is surrounded by other controls  there should be a property on the webview that controls the fullscreen behavior such that it is possible to fill the entire viewable area of the display with the video and its controls  have an api for an application to interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while in background  it will be very useful if user can scan custom qr code from other screen or poster from phone search vision function and launch app via associated uri saved in qr code  an http based api with a program friendly logon e g oauth would be most welcome  there is no good reason for not allowing this so please add it  everyone in the usa has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and i presume microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center  just remove the timeouts completely or at least increase all timeouts by a factor of at least its not a big deal to implement  to go step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system  set up a brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies to a proxy email set up per user  trial feature should be built in with auto prompted and disabling just like the windows store  is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show how many traffic i have by wifi or by gms lte  the reminder function in the wp calendar must be expand to more weekly options  similarly this idea could be thought through for integration of one note with other native applications like camera messaging etc it would be very useful to be able to prepair a mmscomposetask in the same way that we today could use the smscomposetask  we would like to create an app to monitor the time users spend in other the apps enabling enterprise customers to optimize a user s day by analyzing time on applications  i would like to have an option for each skydrive folder to make them available offline  so those folders could be downloaded completely to the phone when a wi fi is available to access them offline later  windows should allow additional user accounts added to track review the application review process similar to what apple and android apple stores allow  please to have competitive advantage i would like you to provide an expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps to be published fast  having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client no matter the vendor is a nice idea  can we have an api to enroll the device through an app or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download  as a developer i would like to have method to defer app deactivation suspending in order to call async methods easily if you are concerned about security reasons a good implementation of this api would be to always notify the user that a message from that application has been sent and where it was sent  we now need to add extra code to reposition it at the top after it has been loaded  i d suggest to include all transactions in the report  all uesr want to find fast their contact when they must call so it s very good to insert the fast search on phone dialer it s good that the user can choose the better method to search like name or and surname or and address etc  i think it s good that th apps can access to the list of installed apps and can decide to unistall or freeze or lock etc  allow downloading of submissioned xap files in windows phone application publish submission process  please make kids corner as a another account  atleast remove password for kidscorner or make another password for kidscorner  allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals would be great to discover service hosts in local networks  provide an automation toolkit to enable developers to walk through a series of steps and take screenshots at relevant points then re run those steps in different languages to automate the process of taking screenshots in different languages for app submission  would also be helpful in it s own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout  as a developer the only way to increase app ratings and review is to prompt user  i was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit  let me be able to see the reviews that are added or app crashes so that my attention towards them grows infinitely large  i want in wp back it stiill works in wp that i can set a color for applicationbar icons  isn t it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture  this would be very useful in the resource constrained environment of a phone   allow more code to be shared across platforms and i would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query to do items that the app created  a shared key chain to share data between the apps this help in apps with features like sso include support for pen input like on the surface pro and surface pro for both wp and rt make it possible to optionally declare a function onclick for live tiles such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen  allow the phone to be used as a mini presentation device  this can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example push tv devices or widi receivers please make it possible to build wp apps  the app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often it will run in the background perhaps by setting a different interval for different days of the week or times of the day or by specifying the time until it will run again each time it runs  users should be given insight into how often an application is running in the background so they can decide which applications are worth allowing to process in the background and which aren t  furthermore the second duration should be expanded to at least seconds to account for larger data transfers and slower network connections  this is also a capability that other mobile platforms have and i think it is needed to build quality apps with a good user experience  apps should get at least seconds of background processing time to complete such network transfers and process the response  in my opinion chinese app are mainly design for chinese and handsets are mostly from china market its may be challenging for developers to get phones from different countries or regions  having said these i propose such feature of prompting to do a language pack installation to be on the windows phone os level when user switches language  having said these i thought a feature for prompting user installing language pack done on phone os level would be good  provide access to playlist api to be able to create auto playlists based on the song library on the phone  if we use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable  for example i would love it if my gps app could turn location on when the app starts and turn it back off when the app exits  an developer should have an option or tool to manage that list and select which ones are displayed  under this suggestion the developer should be unable to manage or modify the base standard images this suggestion is only for adding additional images  the windows phone emulator should include the ability to manage vm snapshots for windows phone images  if you want to load content after you reach the end of a list you have to write your own user control or create data bindings  if navigationservice navigate would let us pass a parameter of type object along with the uri it will help us to keep less states objects in the app class which will become a mess as project grows  please provide a photocroptask that takes an image byte and provides the same crop tool  include a pixelheight and pixelwidth as optional parameters so an aspect ratio can be included  this would allow for picture cropping  provide an api s that allow apps to either control settings eg being able to toggle wifi when nfc tag is interacted  also it would be nice if there was an api that allowed an app to be integrated into the settings applets instead of a standard app  i d like to see the windows app store be similar to google where i can skip the hassle and headache of certification and just get an app on the store in hours not days  allow us developers to renew our expired subscriptions  i ve asked the support they said me that i have to create another subscription with another live account and after it ask them to migrate apps and related data  it s not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had to create because you need to renew the subscription please provide any idea about background service in wm as gps tracking automatically  if windows phone as any faith in its future it needs a lot more support from the development team  if you want people to develop apps you need to offer a dev platform that doesn t only run on the latest and greatest machines  we miss a control like the integrated photo viewer to show photos or any controls page by page by using flick gestures  it should be an option to remove the ru language code from my app language history   you can publish an update with the removed ru language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will in truble  i think placement should be splitted in horizontalplacement left center right and verticalplacement top bottom to have more flexibility  i would like to have a reminder system api that allows me to know if the phone is near a phone from a friend location based  example remind me to ask holly about the project status when i meet her the next time  i think this will be the wrong way   i am a professional software engineer and i am developing with visual studio at work so i thougt its a goot idea to buy a windows phone because i could develop some phone applications  it would be very convenient to just click a button and have your app placed in only the markets that we do not need to worry about taxes  since changing is not an option you will need to create a new account within the turkey region  since you have mentioned that you are a student account this might require you to create to simultaneous accounts  note that if you have a store account the apps from that side will not transfer  it would be great if there were specific classes that could be instantiated on non ui threads and then loaded by ui thread image objects  this would be very useful in determining why sometimes upload is slow mark sideloaded apps in app list so one can differentiate an in store app from a side loaded version that s in development  like surface pro implementing the pressure layer pen on wp and win rt convert exe to appx by command lines  it s century  i know that text boxes can be customized easily  but the uwp textboxes are not that god when it comes to numeric input  i m currently working on a software that has a lot of numeric input  only allows numeric input format numbers with commas on thousands i e  if the user enters a value less than the min value the value will be updated to min value on lost focus  notice that intellisense suggests test for the bind path the same with old stlye binding works fine comparison results with edge on the right  app tested is webview release  tried both webviewexecutionmode separatethread even rendering on separate thread will block ui thread for example reveal highlight effect while bigger page is loading or typing into textbox will lag while javascript in the page is running  currently it is impossible to implement context menus save files and implement other functions general web browsers have  every modern operating system on this planet uses lf style line endings except for windows which still writes one more useless byte at every end of a line  it is time for a change  what can i do  my windows is version build  something in both silverlight and wpf but missing from uwp tiled brushes   although curiously tilebrush is still the base class for brushes just without tiling  this will allow use of tiled images and perhaps videos for use as brushes anywhere a xaml brush is accepted like backgrounds text foregrounds path fills etc  i want my uwp ui to look the same across any screen of the same resolution regardless of the scale factor applied by windows  for instance when running my app on the hololens it applies a scale factor  this means the ui looks squished when compare to a desktop screen of a similar resolution x  can this be implemented for the hololens  there are situations where you might want to interrupt navigating away from a page when using navigationview  say you throw up a message box a la do you want to save the changes yes no cancel if you were to click cancel there s no way to prevent the navigationview to follow through with it visually  say you have two menu items one home and the other whatever  there s no sane way to do it e g  a cancel boolean on the event args of the iteminvoked event  an example for this would be this budgeting app i m currently working on  if you re editing a transaction but haven t committed it trying to navigate away i d like to throw up a save changes  message box with the typical yes no cancel options  i can t deal with the cancel action without code voodoo trying to revert the selecteditem asap  thanks for considering changing this  in my opinion uwp is too much app centric  we are spending and loosing a great amount of time working around trying to do simple things like pass command line arguments write on folders trying to execute another program  os information is not included at all on the usage page  while i get crashes by os health page i need to cross reference this with usage by os to determine the overall impact of a given bug  we are currently developing for desktop only screens we have control over the device types and want to prevent users from sizing the window smaller than px x px  this application is far too complex for mobile screens and x is too small  is this an option we can hope for in the near future  the default menuflyoutsubitem allows you to add subitems either through xaml or the items code behind property  i m currently trying to convert an application that contains some of the coreutils utilities most notably exe and exe  this fails abruptly at preparing virtual file system verbose begin convert files  verbose renaming files directory to vfs  verbose getting all files under c vfs  verbose processing virtual file system entries verbose an error occurred converting your application  here is the full error record  powershell error record  the specified wildcard character pattern is not valid exe powershell stack trace  system management automation wildcardpatternexception the specified wildcard character pattern is at system management automation wildcardpattern ismatch string input  looking at the vfsops ps file it seems that the test path on line assumes that the file path is a standard wildcard not a file name  looks like it could be fixed by adding management automation wildcardpattern escape somewhere but i haven t been able to find out how to make the catalog writeable so that i can test this  when running through c code analysis projects using atl will minimally hit the following atlcom h warnings  buffer overrun while writing to m pdacl the writable size is pdacl aclsize bytes but bytes might be written  buffer overrun while writing to newacl the writable size is aclsize bytes but bytes might be written  orbit view currently have d plane so for mixed reality apps third dimension needed to expand it functionality  like for example for space apps where earth have satellites neo and space stations and they all have orbits based on earth so orbital view in d make it better in mixed reality is there some sort of bug tracker for microsoft software  kinda like uservoice but for bug reports  i have an app that works normally but when launched via the desktop bridge there s some strange issues with com  what does the desktop bridge do differently  coreapplication now has a requestrestartasync method but it fails in a desktop bridge app with notinforeground  i wonder if this is because of the way the desktop bridge technology wraps the wpf application  any ideas on how i can cause the app to restart  however collapsing a pivot item does not remove it from the ui visual tree  the header still exists and is keyboard focus able  since you can correctly hide listboxitems i m considering this a bug  repeatedly calling mediaplayer stepforwardoneframe mediaplayer stepbackoneframe should switch between two frames but video is moving slightly back  repository on github https github com tesar tech mediaplayerframemoveinconsistentbehavior at first this isn t an issue since the control isn t visible  however if you make the parent visible binding will not be triggered and you must manually force an update to get bound values to appear  this was probably done as a performance optimization however binding needs to recognize visibility changes if it won t bind when an item is not visible in the ui  otherwise yet again mvvm is broken  i have a uwp usercontrol line chart that renders a pathfigure to a canvas  this chart supports zooming and the pathfigure size is changed during zoom but clipped within the visible chart area  at high zoom levels above the entire uwp app will crash with a native exception an unhandled win exception occured in app  there must be a bug some place in the framework  this crash only happens using the fall creators update after the clipping issue was fixed  i m guessing it s a numerical overflow somewhere deep in the graphics stack  from my viewpoint i think there is no way in managed code i should be getting a native exception like this  the following hyper v networking configuration breaks dns name resolution on the virtual machine  connecting the host to a non corporate remote wifi network  when a vm is connected to the default switch and the host is connected to the corporate network via cisco anyconnect the vm looses the ability to resolve dns addresses  the vm is able to ping both public addresses and corporate addresses however it is unable to resolve names on either the public internet or corporate network  this issue was submitted as a ms premier support ticket https support microsoft com en us commercial incidents and a connect bug https connect microsoft com windowsserver feedback details build hyper v default switch nat name resolution not working  was advised by premier that this is an architectural issue  start a vm and connect it to the default switch nat  using the fall creator s update version of uwp it seems that when a data context is changed to a new view model the previous view model is updated with null values  this is the same as if the datacontext is set to null before changing view models  it doesn t make sense why the bound values are updated when the datacontext is changed  in stack overflow or any other forums we have option to add multiple tags related to our question  currently is not possibile to create a new calendar inside an enterprise exchange user account  it s only allowed to create an app calendar which lives on local device the windows services store namespace does not provide a class that you can use to simulate license info during testing  at the moment a vsto add in cannot be published on windows store or on office store  an idea could be extending desktop app converter tool in order to manage vsto add in  i reported that since studio the designer crash due to attached properties changing to last uwp solve the designer problem but the attached properties are not working the binding and i have to do set binding by code while understandable that there are big challenges to overcome to make this possible but currently the bar to create optional packages is too high due that the time investment and issues that can occur makes it not that worh it due the c requirement  the createstreamedfileasync method is there since windows to delay creation of file data  however when using the result in a drag drop or clipboard operation windows explorer errors out with x no such interface supported  it can be used between uwp apps but not in windows explorer which really is a shame  there are desktop win apis for delay creation of files that are used heavily e g  in winzip and similar applications to delay actual unzip of files until really required but they cannot be used in uwp  please support the uwp equivalent called createstreamedfileasync in windows explorer  things like minconnectioninterval maxconnectioninterval slavelatency and connection supervisory timeout it is a compendium of various pdf viewer tutorials rolled into a single user control  i have no doubt it could be improved by community involvement  the documentation may be found here  an given example of the api can be seen below  under uwp it is still not possible to open a folder or file out of the sandbox  even to suggest a path is not possible  so your are not able to suggest a folder or file to the user by a path string  so at the moment i have to tell my customers open the folder picker and navigate from the pictures library to the path d very long path final folder  and thereby the folderpicker has no preview to the content in a folder  actual implementing an selection of file or folder in uwp how easy but stupid  so picker suggestedstartlocation is not a string to a path but only a selection of libraries  does microsoft really believe that users and developers accept that lowest budget setup  now after the great windows fall creators update it is still a joke to switch and develop to uwp  does anybody at ms have an idea how to propose an path in an uwp application  we ll currently i have a uwp app that needs to call a web api service that is secured with azure ad  i have been looking for samples and tutorials to do this and i have found some  but they all differ in what to do exactly  i have created apppinmanager helper class just call those helper fuunction it will takecare to add into the startmenu or taskbar for example a long running task where the user is not allowed to back out until it completes  currently uwp community toolkit includes seven services that are very useful but more is always better it would be awesome to add more and more services including a big one for a lot of people wordpress  to clarify that this can be done from windows as a part of windows administration and configuration for instance via group policies powershell windows updates schedule tasks etc  there are several issues with the file activation neighboringfilesquery argument and the file system indexer  if files are loaded using the neighboringfilesquery then getpropertiesasync on those files will only return properties that have been indexed  this prevents reading things like altitude from the gps location data  the above is made a lot worse on computers where indexing file content is disabled right click on the drive in explorer select properties and see check box at the bottom which used to be recommended for ssd drives  in particular no imageproperties are available in this case  it also happens if the indexer isn t working properly which is not uncommon  if the indexer is really broken for some reason this started happening on my pc so is not uncommon then it will fail to pick up any neighboring files at all confirmed by using the default photos app to open a photo in a folder with lots of photos and it only showed one photo  i don t think this is a security issue because the data is in the file and the file contents are readable  this will enable automatic testing on hybrid windows apps where dom inspection is necessary  when setting tooltipservice placement to mouse the text in the tooltip is no longer sharp  it looks like the tooltip is not perfectly aligned to the device pixels but rather half a pixel off vertically  this is on windows fall creators update build dpi scale the app targets windows sdk  would be a lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay  the way ink input is currently handled is sooo win i know there is inkcanvas and windows ui input inking analysis put this should be build into the text controls in a standard way  imagine writing text directly into the textbox or richeditbox canvas without the ink keyboard overlay  it limits the use case of masterview  we can t use pivot semantic zoom gridview pulltorefresh slidablelistitem and more  don t fake the page navigation using storyboard  then devs can use connected animations  i upgraded to the latest vs and change my uwp app to use net native  it now gets a number of linker problems that are being caused by microsoft components  calling this method would throw exception at runtime  if for some reason your p invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use dllimport exactspelling true to indicate that you understand the implications of using non uwp apis i don t call this function  when i traced down some new crashes i found that socket connectasync is trying to call this function and failing because it doesn t exist  i have about similar errors in the build that are referencing things i don t directly call  i ve reverted to net native until this gets fixed  in windows forms toolkit there is a handy control called the numericupdowncontrol  current appextension only supports loading assets and scripts  in many scenarios rd party author may provide some code actable with the main app for example decoding another file format  there may be trusting problems  if you change the datapackageoperation to copy the problem goes away  we are experiencing an issue where the presence of a passwordbox with a numericpin inputscope overrides the inputscope of other controls on the page until the passwordbox has received focus  on a touch screen this manifests every time a user reaches the first page in our uwp app that has a numericpin scoped passwordbox   build and run the app  see that the touch keyboard is the numericpin keyboard even though the focused

player and change some states  i am preloading images for speed and i need to release the memory immediately when no longer needed to prevent memory failures but setting the reference to null and even calling gc collect immediately does not always result in an immediate release of memory  i ve looked into using a softwarebitmapsource instead but this is a lot slower and uses more memory and i m not sure whether its dispose method works doesn t affect memory shown in vs debugger but did seem to have an effect when testing using a mobile emulator  compact overlay window is always shown at the right top corner  conditional check doesn t actually solve the problem it doesn t suit the control like navigationview since at the end developer still have to create a navigationview with splitview which is really pain to maintain  more details can be found in this issue https github com microsoft windowsuidevlabs issues  we can see the support of communities in uwpcommunitytoolkit  as a self learner it is very hard to find a tutorial to learn new things  mapcontrol has some nice extensibility options but requires specifying a token even if you re using local or custom tile sources as the background replacement layer  i hear a lot about clean uninstall but we noticed a few months ago appx leaves some stuff behind  specifically persisted appframe window sizing data remains behind potentially leaving the user dev in a potential bad or confusing window state  see the data piling up in the following stores  a lot of small time developers like myself don t have the means to use the microsoft store to host their apps  i develop applications for the military and the it department barely has any idea what they re doing  win apps still dominate because they re so robust and developed  to bring in new and old developers bring back the same functionality that is found in wpf and winforms  assume the following xaml and not calling setdesiredbounds  this is what the screen looks like https drv ms i s aqt pafuiw htwcfjitfi intxl a  sorry for the photo could not do a regular screen shot at the moment  looks good  yes video and transport controls cover the entire media player  in full screen transport controls not video do also respect the safe area  otherwise this looks cut and incomplete  nevertheless so far this is ok and could be called as expected  so far so good  now let s turn on desiredboundsmode  the safe area is removed and it looks like the following https drv ms i s aqt pafuiw htwdhtsgx pfkcweq page has no more safe area but on the transport controls have suddenly the safe area even though the media player is part within the page   for full screen it remains the same framed version as before so no additional screen shot why are transport controls no longer covering the entire video  that s an real issue  i am removing the safe area by calling setdesiredbounds and i am experiencing framed transport controls then even when using as control somewhere within the page  i debugged this a lot and found a solution and realized a very dirty hack by microsoft  in my app i am using custom transport controls and i used the original template as a starting point  i found out that there is a grid element with x name controlpanelgrid and on xbox it gets magically a margin of  this is documented nowhere and has the bad effect described above  removing the x name or renaming that element is enough the margin is gone  nevertheless i would expect a less hacky solution  having a safe area within a media element s transport controls when not full screen is definitely a bug  and fiddling arround with a grid by name is just a dirty hack since this does not work with custom transport controls as long as the magic grid with it s name is not present  the mediaplayerelement supports various subtitle formats  but when we play a video file using mediastreamsource it is not possible to pass through the subtitle streams because we cannot create mediastreamdescriptors for them  so audio and video works but subtitles don t work  this would be very helpful to make the ms initiated ffmpeginterop truly unviersally useful  i am unable to use containers and vmware virtualbox on windows at the same time due to the restriction of hyper v  this restriction does not exist on linux and macos  why force me to reboot to disable

announced support for fragmented mp backed hls streams under hls version https developer apple com videos play wwdc at wwdc  we are looking to change the way our hls streams are generated and windows seems to be one of the few platforms that doesn t support playing these type of streams  i have to make a stub of the class in the local project which causes duplicate of code  i submitted this to the vs forum but they said to post the issue here  if the datatemplate x datatype models localstatus references poco class that is in a seperate project the xaml will not compile  we now have this option for listview and gridview but not for the combobox control  the streamsocket class has no good way of polling the connection status without sending data your connection may have died minutes ago but you won t know until you try to send something which isn t desirable  many of the old implementations in net and even in vb socket control had this functionality and it was highly useful  the proposal is to add something like something happened update your ui or run your business logic while downloading a file with backgrounddownloader the progress updates every mb which is not really accurate  i ve noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate to about every ms  this would allow us to easily use different itemtemplates for each group in conjunction with groupstyleselector  there are many cases where you have different kind of data and group them by data type  imagine a image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images  or you display search results for various item types in one view  it is possiblte to achieve this right now using the normal itemtemplateselector on listview gridview  but it causes a context switch from native net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing a lot of items this is noticeable on slow devices or phones  plus as i read in the docs this can degrade virtualization performace as the control does not know upfront which items need which template  now the control does not need to call selector for every item speeding up the control   m writing this feedback in desktop bridge because i think this team is the innovative and will do a better job of communicating these problems to windows store team  desktop bridge attracts me as a developer but windows store puts me off  currently the only way to find programs are if you type their names  there are no keyword searches  this has been like that for many years but no one has done anything about it  if you wonder why developers are not jumping on to something as attractive as desktop bridge this is the reason  there are many threads on internet discussing this issue but windows store team doesn t seem to listen  otherwise the private store can only be used for in house apps or free apps  a content control that enables the user to use inking to enter text in textboxes including richeditbox  each javascript app that uses a video element in the ui and calls the play function to stream the video preview from camera to the app page will crash after recent windows update  this crash occurs in all javascript apps that use the mediacapture api to display camera video previews  for this reason apps programmed in javascript that use video or photo capturing are from now on non functional in windows  according to the documentation it is possible to x bind events to a handler  when working with parameters this works as long as the parameters have the default names  so for the calendarview selecteddateschanged event the following signature works  this behavior is not found in public documentation  but i couldn t find any option in my dev center account to support this functionality  in dx you can t read and write to the same texture and that s fine i can live with that  however the api was designed that it will introduce severe overhead in the following scenario  these objects are semi transparent alpha blending so i need to draw them sorted by distance to camera back to front and not by state changes  let s assume i have objects which are soft particles sp  and objects that are triangle meshes tm  both sp and tm use alpha blending  sp don t do depth writes but they do depth tests and depth reads in the shader  tm do depth writes and depth tests but they don t do depth reads in the shader  by depth writes i mean the d d depth stencil desc depthwritemask so both sp and tm do legal operations they don t write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time  however in the worst case when sp and tm are ordered in the following way  i have to change the depth stencil view using omsetrendertargets for each draw call to set the same depth texture but with view that has d d dsv read only depth enabled or disabled  so in order to draw them all i have to do  to my understanding omsetrendertargets is a slow operation but i need to call it times  and the calls to omsetrendertargets are really useless because the same depth texture is used just with a different view and because both sp and tm do legal operations they don t write to the depth buffer and read in the shader at the same time   i don t need to create depth stencil views for each depth buffer one with d d dsv read only depth enabled and one with disabled   i don t need to call omsetrendertargets for each draw call where i want to change d d dsv read only depth  but i just stick to normal depth writes d d depth stencil desc depthwritemask this artificial limitation is also the cause for bugs in webgl in chrome firefox  once you start working on webgl in ms edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because in gles webgl it s legal to read from the depth texture while it s bound to the fbo and you will have to do checks for each draw call if depth stencil view needs to be changed to have d d dsv read only depth or no  say i have objects to draw  sp don t do depth writes but they do depth tests more see github issue for more information and scenarios https github com microsoft windowsuidevlabs issues  it s extremely annoying when i face service issues with

even having a web browser control if it isn t going to have full browser features minus the tabs settings url input box etc  since edge doesn t support lockdown usage like ie did with kiosk mode it makes it even more important to have this  i add a customaudioeffect which is eq i ve also tried using official uwp sample s echoeffect to mediaplayer  although it seems customaudioeffect is running

few occasions that i ve needed to use it they ve generally completed a review in a few hours  this is useful for situations where a critical security flaw is identified or where a trade show or other

 why not allow the creation of pdfs without print dialog interaction  master detail with x bind is not working properly  when you use x bind to bind a textbox to a property of the selecteditem of a listview this problem exists   you select a new item in the listview your changes from are lost because the selection in the listview changes before the lostfocus event of the textbox was raised  that means the change was never written back to the original item  this bug more description and the code to reproduce it can be found in this blogpost  the updatetask or preconfigurationtask capabilities

component  the user opens the app looks at the calendarview with today highlighted and lets the app run into the next day  the user looks at the calendarview the today highlight doesn t update and therefore shows yesterday s date as today as well as a return method that allows you to return to the dialog before it after the new dialog has run such as if you want a returning password entry or something  i m considering rewriting it as a queue for dialogs as currently it will only display one dialog and queue one dialog meaning if you try to queue two it will fail  this is a helper to ensure safe handling of content dialogs this will help prevent exceptions from trying to open a content dialog when one is already open  methods involve async and non async opening if you want the result or not these methods have a boolean that lets you specify whether you want to wait for the dialog before it to close before showing it so you can show break through dialogs such as error or

suspension period  before recent changes we were ab using the reset event type to inform the ui components that the collection has changed  in the current version we have optimized the collection so it knows exactly what has changed in the suspension state  we will only invoke the correct add remove actions for all the items  unfortunately it looks like the ui components in this case a listbox cannot deal with the add and multiple items  this does not work  the event args implementation correctly contains all the added items and the right indexes all covered by unit tests  for some notes on the investigation see https github com catel catel issues  i think this is a bug in the way the ui components deal with the notifycollectionchangedeventargs instance  if it s add the components don t

presently not possible for the developers to raise support issues for store problems  it requires the company account to be signed in to raise the case  this is a real problem where we have multiple teams that are shipping apps and we need to share the master account name and password with lots of people thus removing any value of using ad federation  winappdriver does not work with windowsfindby annotation because appiumfielddecorator forces the get context command which is not supported by winappdriver  i understand winappdriver does not currently support webview and therefore it does not support context switching so context command is not provided  however the context switching is not required to support windowsfindby annotated element  then appium will happily use the native locator  i can get the page source with current winappdriver and i see all the elements returned have the attributes for size width height or position x y but the values of those attribute are all zero  i think this is the reason why appium inspector does not highlight the element position in the screenshot images when an element was selected in the app source tree or clicking on the screenshot does not select the corresponding element in the app source tree  a control for selecting an emoji that works like the datepicker control and a flyout for selecting an emoji that works like the

where i m running into trouble is that things like flyouts and dialogs intercept any and all access to the event   event registration order doesn t seem to make a difference  this makes for problems

next button on left side of the control will be a previous button  next previous behaviour the available screen will show the max number of items in the row of the control according to size of the

getting birthday notifications a day too early   the date in the peoplehub does not align with the calendar   with wp we have the unique ability to offer trails for paid apps which is great   however it would be nice if developers could offer free apps with a possibility to users for voluntary donations   some devs do the workaround and offer a paid app with the trial version having no restrictions at all if the user clicks buy he essentially donates to the dev   however this workaround has the disadvantage of the app not apprearing in the free category though they are actually free   therefore it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two buttons install free and install and donate e g   the price could be splitted just like with paid apps just with the difference of the app appearing in the free category   the current process is very lengthy and costly for non us developers   why can t microsoft simplify it   make it similar if not the same as google   having read through the cumbersome process i am more incline to build free apps with subscription rather than getting any money through the marketplace   having to deal with physical paperwork sending it back and forth is a step backwards we are living in a digital world   there are heaps and heaps of really good developers outside of us who really want to contribute to making windows phone a preferred choice so please microsoft make it simplier and make it digital   it would be really helpful if for example a developer makes an app that takes advantage of the schedule alarm api and would like to enable the user to select a custom ringtone for that alarm   this api proposal would enable the user to select from many ringtones already available on the phone and save developers the trouble of having to implement their own custom ringtones   if you try to copy paste multiple recipient number to the to box in the messaging the nd until the last number will be duplicated   even as a developer we can create most of the apps for individual users that is standalone   if we need to target corporates then then we would need more apis for device management also like zune for a single user we would need an enterprise server application which can control the devices of employees remotely where we can apply corporate policies on the device as well   make some usefull app that run ussd code   please allow the access to gmail s todo list sync when a google account is added on the windows phone   under calendar i see the todo list of hotmail and i like it it would be great if i can add the gmail s ones too and have the ability to make changes when sync happens or just have the ability to add todo items and those get sync to the phone   hi the biggest icon size requited is x bit in the marketplace single app page this is resized to x losing quality   you can t add update delete alarms or reminders from a backgroundagent   it d be great if we at least has the ability to change edit reminders and alarms that were created by that app   and i want to get that response to my app to hanle it   it would be very useful to be able to change the names that my apps appear as when i check the app hub dashboard   developers must be given additional enumeration values in socketype and protocoltype to create variety of sockets like raw sockets based on icmp igmp etc   allow to create alert and reminder from background task execution   allow orientation horizontal on a listbox i would like to use the selectionchanged event handler to create a menu using the listbox control   as the heading says provide tools to prevent users from reinstalling apps rather than buy the full version and stop devs from being deprived of purchases that they deserve   as half the point of my app is the information on the live tile i d like to have a polite reminder show every so often if they haven t pinned it but i simply don t know whether they have or not   disable the feature entirely   detect when there is a screen shot attempt so we can programmatically not display obscure or watermark our graphics   like android we need phone level events like sms received sent event camera on off event phone turned on off event keypad lock event etc   i would like a phone remote in windows   once a application is installed in wp there should be some way to run that application without user input i e   specifically we will want the ability to have selective enabling of application features so that when the wp are run after server side conversion   on newer hardware they switch to the newer profile   barring that at least allow for merged listings for wp and wp versions so that customers have a clear upgrade path for the same application   or you could just support the native sdk direct x on wp   i ll take that over the previous two   barring that at least allow for merged listings for wp and wp versions so that customers have a clear upgrade path for more   the concept explains itself well in below blogpost winrt transitions creating fast and fluid metro uis http www scottlogic co uk blog colin winrt transitions creating fast and fluid metro uis   using vodafone gsm and the used data includes unicode characters thus whole message is failed   i could imagine that in the same way the sms icon is shown on the lockscreen a mini app icon is shown aswell from apps that got notifications facebbok whatsapp   add an option to delete future appointment in calendar and preserve previous when used the option to repeat   platform should provide access to call log so you can create applications which for example retrive unknown numbers from call log and find their information from public directories   the customized unlock apps are very popular on android and symbian we hope that we could do the same on wp   at the moment there is to relation between companies and countries   it s ok for small business but what about bigger one   we have several dev centers in countries and extra sales offices in more countries   same time wp registration intends we must use country only   these descriptions also appear differently depending on where they are being viewed web zune on pc or device   the update description field has a documented purpose but then in the forums i read that this field does not appear in the marketplace   please provide a way to predictably introduce newlines into the description fields let me see how these fields will render in the different environments wysiwyg show me how the update description will be used in my updated app there does not seem to be a way to control newlines in the application descriptions on the marketplace   please provide a way to predictably introduce newlines into the description fields let me see how these fields will render in the different environments wysiwyg show me how the update description will be used in my updated more   quicker way to go to the bottom of the metro screen to view tons of pined apps   i currently develop for android and ios   i am interested in developing for windows phone but would need a device to pay registration and learn a rd platform to do so   that involves a lot of time which is a large risk to smaller development companies   if microsoft created some incentives like a free device blackberry did this and a free year of membership amazon did this it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off   i would jump at the opportunity to adapt my apps for windows phone if microsoft created incentives for me to try the platfrom   cant use keyboard in landscape mode in some app   you would finally be able to add and customize your alert and text sounds   of course each app would have permission accepted by user and each app would have own isolated storage for more private   it would be nice to see windows phone move to optional vector based icons instead of static bitmaps   this would allow the application bar or appbar to resize if say hd screens were added   ideally users would only need icons for the marketplace tile contains the application name and list just the icon for the app list   appbars could be created at x and resized as needed   i know this is a pain on developers that are not designers or have designers but an option would be nice time saver for the future   it would be nice to be able to delete a cert you have uploaded   i d like to be able to decorate my home screen by pinning my favorite photos directly from within the pictures application   allow users to organize tiles into separate hubs   a secondary start hub i can use to store occasionally used apps would be good   an automated hub for recently used apps would also be good   please allow the access to phone filesystem   it would be a great benefit if the developers can manipulate the sdcard resources etc etc   hp have the eprint functionality apple the airprint   can you not make connection to these devices possible   i want to give a textbox a placeholder text   this now requires creating a custom control   i want this to be available out of the box   oh and i want the option to create labels for the textbox   provide the access to pictures in photochooser and camera roll in emulator   since the easiest way to get hold of files to be used in programs is by downloading them from a network or the internet and saving them in isolated storage it would make the whole thing a lot easier if you could do this with ftp   ftp is still one of the most used protocols for retrieving files   and using a proxy is not always an options since some of us would like to be able to reach ftp servers that is on a separate network   imap idle for push emails and sync read forward and answered mails plus sync send folder   email for business is very impotant   for all the guys girls over the years old de need a really big clock in the main display   thanks sorry about my english   positioning cursor is almost imposible   wp should support ussd menu and umb as well   once removed the metro interface looks good from a desktop app but on the mobile phone is horrible   when the volume is in the rang the volume does not decrease   continuing my prior post about allowing us to explicitly flip secondary live tiles with a tap instead of launching the app this request would allow such an action to explicitly update the tile by triggering a function call in a background task   perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating updating the tile flip the tile execute a background task or both or simply launch the app like normal possibly with deep toast   that would really make livetiles live which now they kind of aren t and were by far the biggest disappointment when we saw the actual sdk   coming from ios when we did see that we scrapped two apps we were going to release on wp   a third was scrapped because of the inability to do location tracking in a background task more frequently than once every minutes which is sort of the same stale data issue as here   since it s user initiated it wouldn t drain more   in the schedule namespace ist isn t possible to have access to the media library to play songs user has already on his device please add this function to get access to the media library   another thing is to have the possibility to modify the notification wich is shown when the alarm or reminder rings   we need to open our application or to overwrite the notify to costumize it to get a better improvement for the user   extend the api to query phone volume and vibration settings maybe even set them   please provide validation templates for windowsphone controls   however not everybody has a physical device so having those experiences in the emulator would be a great addition to the dev tools and resources   would be nice and useful to have email messages grouped by date same as contacts grouped by initial letter   for sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package   perhaps that could be available as toolkit in codeplex com   there needs to be an alpha test mechanism available   since the beta test versions i recently submitted have been waiting for certification for days there is no way for us to work together on this   my boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner   if the beta program certified apps in a day then this might not be a problem   as it is it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner   we need support special multitasking tasks like voip and im   we can t create good apps for this services without this api looks on your skype client wtf   ios already has this api s   volume on headphone when phone rings while listening to a song raise to max volume   multi select on zune to delete albums or to create a playlist   read write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles based on week days time position etc   implement soundwave touchless api on the phone for touch free metro   microsoft boffins showed how they can use audio via the speaker and microphone and a dopplar computation to detect gestures without touching the screen   i want to use that on the phone for some games   in the submission process publishers should be able to check a box for apps that are made for individuals or older and or older   this should flag a feature in the marketplace when an app is being downloaded to verify the age of the downloader   in wp you can add multiple accounts of different types live google facebook etc   it would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts   for example get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails   i think there are two ways to improve the beta program   make apps available immediately   when developing on ios using testflight or android we don t have to wait two hours for beta code to be approved   we upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately   if immediate approval is not possible then apps that have been published should be immediately available   when we receive emails saying the beta application is published users are not able to download the application with the very own links provided in the email   users are reporting a day time between when the app is approved to when it is available for download   users receive a strange marketplace error when trying to download the application   when developing apps it is often useful to leverage existing launchers and choosers as tasks to access certain data or perform an operation   currently this is only exposed for system level data and operations   it would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks   imagine shopping apps being able to share a set of data such as a wish list or news apps being able to share a list of news feeds   imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data   it would be the responsibility of the app to decide what it exposes for data or functionality   this can first be alleviated as with other security screening by prompting the user to allow an app to access another app s tasking features   in such case you d better make your videos carefully so that it can leave a good user experience to the potential clients   if you convert video to flv flash video which features much smaller size than popular formats your videos will be watched unhinderedly with quick loading   select flv as output format   if you are more requirements of your video such as bit rate encoder etc you are do these settings one by one in the pop up formats window   when everything is finished you can click start button to start the video to flv conversion process   you are allowed to preview the converting process in slideshow   mpeg or ect   if you convert video to flv flash video which features much smaller size than more   allow the backgroundaudioplayer to play tracks from the medialibrary   or allow applications that implement the xna mediaplayer class to run in the background   please add the possibility to add your own spell check service or provide the data if a system wide one existed   when i want to build some tiles in my app i have to use buttons that i give a custom style   but this is ugly since everyone implements this in another way resulting in odd alignments bad text colours etc   we need a simple and standardized way to create simple tiles that function as buttons   beta testers test our apps for free   it would be nice if when the app game is published in the marketplace we could include a list of the testers that helped us so they can get the app from free instead of having to buy it   android ios and blackberry are compatible with this api so why don t we   i would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side so when left handed people scroll they could also see the content   visual studio and new expression blend   merge products together   add open app in marketplace in the app menu rate review uninstall pin to start   it does not look professional when scrolling upward at the end of any page or downward at the top the content of the page regardless of material or application will be stretched down   it is part of the effect through the whole operating system and does not particularly belong to any application   sometime the stretched content of the page does not look professional   we need upd broadcast to search for our devices in the network   when an exception is thrown and intercepted by the debugger edit and continue permits to change your code right while debugging to make the code continue   we can allow music that is not copyrighted to be accessible if that is a huge issue   link to sql is not efficient at all could they include sql sqlight or other library   it s impossible to connect easily to ftp network i suggest to include it in the future sdk   we want an office hub that open openoffice document   currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox is recommended   why can t i change phone search and ie search to google or another provider that actually work   fix bing or fix the phone   at best this is unclear but should the user pan or zoom they lose the frame of reference for the place we re trying ot show them   you can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you re trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results   if the search finds nothing you get no pin   or if the search finds something other than what you intended you can end up with a pin or pins far from where you want them   if it were possible to tell the task to show a pin or pins at a specific point or points that that would allow for a better user experience   even if we could just specify a label for the pin that would be better than nothing   add an option private to lock photos movies songs calendar appointments   an exit button should be there on all application software s   show used volume so you can see how much mb of your inclusive volume is already used   we could just upload a csr and microsoft provide a signed certificate via their own ca   it would be nice if a choice between vibration and the sound is given for typing   pin settings airplane mode wifi etc in the start screen   allowing for tester groups or profiles would allow for efficient test setup in the marketplace especially for multiple products by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the marketplace as a beta   additionally it would be great to have additional support for enterprise developers that target a specific set of clients as opposed to the public masses of the marketplace   while at the same time providing additional benefits to larger enterprise level corporations   ideally a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients   allowing for tester groups or profiles would allow for efficient test setup in the marketplace especially more   if the app shows sensitive data when deativated it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application   daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis in the same way like periodic tasks   microsoft should advertise windows phone development apis in visual studio   please make it instead fire an event which could be used to open an app s search bar or page   at least support displaying static gif image   back and forward buttons needed not the capacitive back button   please consider to enable support for unsafe code in silverlight and xna apps   maximizing all current main apps would be better than having mil appd in the marketplace   create option to allow periodic agents to run even if app has not been opened for x days   this gives my family up to four live accounts   on an xbox we can log in and play games no problem yet a w phone allows for only one user   i can t even log in to another account to check or edit it let alone play games with it   a certain rival brand of phones allows users to switch between their live equivalent accounts with no problems whatsoever   i bought my wp phone with gaming in mind but there s more than one gamer in this house please make it possible for several gamertags to be used on one device   keeping the message as draft when exiting would save me the hassle of having to type it again   can we have windows phone development using visualstudio lite ide which includes only phone developement   start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word such as childrens stories so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps   secondly you need to limit the number of apps that a publisher can submit with a particular key word   we should have some way within our app to get notify that whether user selected call don t call and when he she ended call means notification of end call   it would be more useful if specific service apps could be released that would extend these features by for example adding a google option to the sharing interface   would be nice if in power point could have same method as in pictures hub for navigation   received from an mvp this week over email it would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the nmea file format either via file import export or using the files directly as a feed   other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by windows phone   they all use sip so it would be great to have a native sip client integrated   also a t keyboard would be nice too   i want to be able to add a picture to the media library and then start the sharepicturetask to let the user see and share it from the pictures hub   remove the apps limit from the phone and app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for an app with a search term   add a quick access block button function to be used when receiving spam over chat   i would like to see a monthly yearly subscription model introduced that let me charge users a year for my app for example   we really need assembly binding redirection or publisher policies in windows phone   it would be great if you could add png support to the medialibrary so that we can save high quality png files to the picture library   being able to use simple uncompressed wav files would open up many possibilities for ring tone editors and make files recorded from the microphone ready to be used as ringtones   it would be great if the windows phone development team could allow us to use the rstp streaming protocol in net compact framework we use   provide preference setting to categorize apps in the long list by their categories in app store rather than names or alphabetical order this is extremely helpful for people with lots of apps and provide the ability to maintain the uniformity of the ui while making it more user friendly   this will provide more usability of the live tiles on the start menu especially when one needs to drag multiple tiles through long list   please get metequotes to make metatrader for windows phone   need of logger class to log error info verbose and daemon information   as it is available in android it improves the debugging process   it displays the certificate signer information but you could easily upload two certificates with different cns service names issued by a single ca and you would have no way of telling them apart   minimally it should show the cn from the subject which matches the service name you provide in client code along with the cn of the signer   ideally it would allow you to download the certificate for verification or at least provide a md hash of the uploaded certificate   right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback   allow the user to be able to set a custom reminder time such as hours or hours before the calendar entry   at present you only provide fixed values like hr or hr before   tesco club card app shows you points and you have you clubcard bar code avaible on your phone to scan at checkout   apps has your nectar that you are able to scan in stores also shows you your points balance and allows you to shop online and collect more nectar points   i would like a button i can click that will only select the countries for which microsoft already accounts for any taxes   support file transfer such as pdf files   a bevy of restrictions can also be heaped on the said user control in order to maintain performance and not sap battery life   let live tiles be live please   when an alarm pops up an option to edit the reminder should be included instead of having to constantly hit snooze or exit the reminder and go into the object itself   i need a posibility to set the keyboard language from code   the focus on textbox opens the keyboard with the german layout the focus on textbox opens the keyboard with a greek layout   true i have tested this and it works fine   if the keyboard is not installed nothing changes and the current layout remain   please implement this it is important for me for a translation application   i suggest to create hardware ratings like ones in winows wei for the smartphone in order to help both users and developers to match hardware with apps or games   i think that this ratings will even enable developers to create different versions of the same app pointing to specific hardware   it would be nice to be able to use the computer keyboard when using the emulator   it s a bit frustrating to type with the mouse   we can t use some important libraries in the background agent like microsoft devices sensors that limite our power to creat a good application   currently you can only pin an album but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile that way you have easy access to a it   school schedule bus route or a picture of someone you like   the current adcontrol crashes any app which uses the silverlight xna hybrid mode   apparently this has never worked nor communicated to devs   i normally wouldn t say this is unexceptable but given that silverlight xna hybrid is the new big thing for wp this issue needs immediate attention   which is useful if you want to add an appointment with the same time location notes as a previous one   currently when you press and hold an appointment in the calendar you have the option to edit or delete   you either have re enter all the info or change the date of the old appointment but that s not ideal because you lose record of old appointments   local scout should show more than just results there should be the ability to state the radius from current location and all businesses within that radius should be shown which could greatly exceed also if searching a company name for a small business restaurant it would be good if that could show within local results   often i try to search for a restaurant and there is no result under local instead i have to find their website and then their postcode   this would save me that hastle and make planning journeys much simpler   allow an app to disable text messaging preview   allow users to link their app with the me and people hub directly   now that we have api access to contact information it would be useful to immediately be able to click on a contact and open it in a related app e g   skype twitter etc   add a full support of regioninfo and add possibility to instanciate one with two letter iso code   so we can use it to dispal country name with user language   add option to hide keyboard specially when you want to copy a long text the keyboard takes around of your lcd space leaving you with a tiny window to work with   exactly as the title says   can you please create a tesco clubcard app   allow the ability to view ssl certificates on https connections in ie and have the option to install the ca   i suggests to add some kind of storage to store gps poi   in addition this storage may have integration with contacts to allow user have geographical map of his contacts   port internet explorer to a mobile version as soon as ie is ready to get all new ie features to our mobile phones so we can build better webapps for windows phone   pls support fixed possitioned elements   i d like to have tiles of various colours on my start screen   allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available   it would be nice if there were an app that logged things that happen on your phone ie   it would be also great if there were an icon in the status bar that indicates that that are new events notifications   i d like the ability for an application to be quick loaded from the right hand corder of the lock keypad   if that s not possible allow a button to be overriden and pressed during the locked screen process   also i want to be able to set the left of power for when the batterysaver kicks in   the default setting is way too late i d prefer or more remaining before turning on   it d be very convenient for developers without actual devices to test their apps for the certification requirements if everything could actually be tested with the emulator   please upgrade the youtube app by microsoft corp with metro ui instead directing to a mobile site   expose the songcollection class so we can add and remove song objects from custome song collections   allow the backgorundaudioagent to utilise the xna framework so that the device s song library can be played and manipulated from the background   you would also need to provide a conversion mechanism to convert a song to an audiotrack as is the default file type for the bap   relax the restrictions around application running under a locked screen and or in the background   unless of course we go with a predetermined songcollection such as songcollection limitedplaylist more   we need the ability to build apps that are capable of video editing for wp   please devgroup make this apis should enable developers to build apps that include the ability to do video trimming editing and saving to the video library   this is needed to build voip application   playing audio stream in loudspeaker is uncomfortable for users   sir i have samsung omnia w its running latest update   when i charged my phone then the key press becomes laggy and hard   allow applications to define custom shaders in hlsl   this will allow sophisticated game graphics and real time image processing   also allow access to mp encoder library hardware accelerated so apps can generate their own videos   this should also allow apps to read existing videos modify frames and write them back   for gps tracking apps   there is an android app which displays all local wifi connections with their channel number strength and of course name   wpf should have one like this too   currently i can detect and control what the embedded zune player is currently playing   the same can t be done with rd party apps implementing background audio streaming like soundtracker etc   hello thank you for this site   i was very happy to be able to scan barcodes from the search button and i would like to use this in my application   the design guidelines should be the law   don t allow ugly interfaces be stricter on things like navigation general look and feel even animation   give developers good explanation what they do wrong and enforce good design   if something is unresponsive it should not be allowed unless there is a clear and good reason for it   apps should take no longer than seconds to start and need to explain why they would take longer   make the marketplace of the highest quality out there   support for webgl like the rest of the world microsoft have done this too many times we as ms developers are starting to look stupid years behind on the mobile market ballmer ipad s are just under powered pc s gates the internet is just a fad enough admit you are wrong early rather than late it s much easier that way   the biggest problem i almost exclusively run into when working on wp apps is the layout performance of silverlight   it s takes quite some effort to work around that problem   and according to web searches about this problem i felt that i m not a lone with this   it d be great if you would work on a solution to improve the situation   too often we come across a word in an app we might not know or we just want to confirm the meaning of it we colud look it up right where u r without the need to exit n go in to another app   with this mod we can enjoy the platform more the than ever before is to make in the landscape like the upcoming windows or like the original tile home screen from up to down or down to up   an address bar should be added to calendar items to give the location of your appointment meeting   this address should be visible on the bing maps showing you the location of your calendar item   vice versa you should be able to schedule via the bing maps adding a location on the maps and linking it to the calendar   return back a multi task support may be optional will significal improve advanced users experience   in current situation its almost impossible to create some kind of applications such as different trackers survilence etc   a color picker control just like the one in the phone s settings would be really useful for apps which want to offer the user a choice of colors   i know i can code one but it should be one of the standard controls   the current ie mobile browser doesn t support keyup correctly   i d like to show youtube videos in my app   i would like to have control over the size positioning and playback of a video   there should be an option to change the working of these buttons to double click so that a slight   allow for video camera control start and stop recording from the touch screen instead of just the camera button   a demo or prototype category like it exists on android would solve this issue   as of now the number of contacts that can be added to a group is restricted to please remove the cap   already music streaming is supported but only for single songs   would t it be great to add albums to skydrive and stream them directly from there   prefferably the albums would be integrated in the music videos hub similarly to jow skydrive pictures are integrated in pictures hub   all notifications should exist in a pull down shade in ios android style   the pull down shade should take on the color theme you have choosen for your phone   notifications should exist within the shade as black tiles and will illustrate the notification type and a short phrase from the email sms text facebook twitter mention etc   have a background agent enable all the time to execute an application event not execute them periodically   ability to add a custom buttons to system call app like in screenshots http bit ly incomingscreen http bit ly incallscreen click on button will launch some callback which will access to   access to call voice stream in out   access to call controls can initiate a new call end exists etc all features provided by standard buttons on call page   currenty when you hit the back button from the folders in the mail app it takes you back to homescreen   please fix this so that it goes back to inbox and not exit the app   in addition to the current alphabetical view add sorting options like sort by last installed sort by recently accessed also it would be nice to have a shortcut screen like the fullscreen blue alphabet tiles but with dates day ago week ago weeks ago   doing something like the actual webbrowsertask but with uri pointing to file in isolatedstorage   add a method to run another app passing params   there should be a function to costumise the tile depending on mood   if the homescreen s tile automaticaly arranged in recent most used favart and latest updated   then it would be better   let us buy internet free sms or minutes in our career codes   let us call codes # i think it s one of the most important things here   support for word wrap or something would let us give more meaningful titles to our apps with less app title duplications   the ability to broadcast and bind sockets to a port would be handy for making local client server applications where you don t need to specify the server ip   we want a clean and simple interface which works   i for example wrote four applications in about two days   getting them all published took me over three months   it s just not right   the process particularly for someone under the age of of getting a dreamspark account particularly now that you ve messed up that website and an app hub account is absolutely awful more   windows phone dev is powerless without low level api to access drivers or add features to phone   i have developed an app which plays audio using the backgroundaudioplayer   if i am listening to audio over bluetooth and i pause the audio if the bluetooth device disconnects the audio resumes playing   i run continous background processing in my app frequency analysis of the mic if anyone cares   i d like to control the priority of this background thread to make the user experience better   we note that microsoft bought skype so we need an app that includes facebook chat skype chat video call and normal calling   enterprise feature   calendar functionality does not allow for specifying end date for meeting or appointment   bring back reccurrence from wm where you could create complex meeting schedules   then i can write an app to simulate a keyboard or a mouse and don t need software on pc   in sdk give an ui explorer view for isolated storage to download upload isolated storage files from device to desktop   this will help in testing out and debugging applications which use isolated storage significantly   it is not possible to send an email with an attachement i e   when applying for a job   a faster way to switch between vibration on and off than having to open settings ringtones sounds   it would be nice with a switcher on the volume control like the button ring silent   android gives you the capability to zee how much storage a particular app uses we could really do with this   when ever i make a call my phone s screen goes dark even if im not puting it on my ears   ive read alot of concerns regarding this problem   why shouldn t i as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries   here in denmark there aren t that many wp users yet so a lot of apps will show up in the marketplace without any reviews even though you can see in apptracker that there exist some reviews   to sell phones with qwerty sliding like htc pro arrive while os is not providing landscape for all apps is something between ridicolous and unfair   when you enter a wrong word in the keyboard dictionary e g while typing in word   the only way to remove it is to clear the full dictionary by using keyboard typing settings reset suggestions   we need a way to select the word s we want to delete   control to send desired picture to native pinch to zoom controller   one line of code to enable native picture viewer with pinch to zoom   instead of having to tap the screen you should have the choice of locking it at the top of the screen   tuenti is a social network as facebook in spanish or english or catalan it would be very useful for spanish people or south americans or people who have signed up on it to have it integrated into the people hub   i have a lot spanish friends who have hesitated to buy a windows phone and finally didn t buy it because their favourite social network wasn t neither on the marketplace neither on the people hub   android has the pull down notification area well we should have a live tile where all notifications come in so if ur using an app n its not pin to ur start screen u can still know when u have a notification   possibility of viewer and writter rar files and native support rar would good job   the built in support for some dpws devices would be nice especially printing to wsd printers or capturing images from wsd scanners would be a significant feature   implementing such protocol is not impossible and printing from applications would be welcome not only by developers but by end users as well once available in office applications etc   if phone is lost allow remotely setting custom message on the lock screen i e contact information   as for now the picturedecoder can only decode jpg and run on the ui thread   i am especially thinking about tile generation on background agents i d like to have an enriched picturedecoder able to run on any thread and decode png as well   extended ability to highlight text or links within apps such as facebook and twitter for copy paste individual text word highlight of a text bubble with the wp txts   improoved text edit cursor positioning when highlighting text close to the top of the screeb or too far down the scrolling plays up anf makes it awkward to get it right   wifi data transfer wp to wp   the ability for applications to follow the data connection of the device especially edge g etc   if they run as background tasks with live tiles as most carriers provide limited amount of connection   we can able to call managed code functionality in silver light   but in windows phone for silverlight dosnt provide the dll system windows browser   better multitasking with the ability to have background applications on   example i am playing a game and i pause and want to play later   then i want to use my phone as usual go in to other apps and that kind of stuff   then later when i want to continue playing from where i paused i hold the back button and i see that game is open in the background not only the latest apps   it would be really cool if developers could get api access to xbox live gamertags that way they don t have to make users create a new account just to play multiplayer games   it would also help a lot for leaderboards too   if you look at all of the most popular programs in any field photoshop office chrome etc one thing is always constant and that is rd party extensability   bring this to windows phone to all native apps   instead of making a new camera app allow me to extend the native one   bring this to all of the native apps including office the dialer people hub etc   tab is usefull to jump from textbox to another e g   in the registration forms using only the keyboard   arrows keys to move easly throught the text   when you have more than groups you need to scroll down in case you want to find a single contact   the a z button should open the letter grid to jump to the desired point in the list   i would like it to work just like the walgreens app   the mango way to switch between tab is slow as so please implement a quicker way to do that or roll back to the previous ie s chrome   greater permission to manage the music   help define the current position of the current music with the mediaplayer zune seek position   to obtain another possibilities to move in the music as the default button fast forward   in a windows desktop alt tab is used to switch quickly between apps   we need something just as fast in wp   one suggestion is double tap home icon quickly to see the list of open apps as shown currently   this is faster than holding down the back key for some time   zune payer should support custome codec plugin so one can play any format   please expand the messageboxbutton option in silverlight to include a yes no or yes no cancel option   it would be nice to have a modal control that is standard between applications with additional user choices available   the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened in it   the last five should be frozen and any more than that should have to restarted   to close an app the user should be able to use her his finger to flick it upwards webos style   in addition the user should be able to take a screenshot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are more   it will be very useful if you can asign a static ip   ipv begins to be widely supported   it was available in wm and older so it would be great to see this included in wp and later   allow sync of ms exchange notes   because push notifications can easily go unnoticeable there should be a history in the me tile that will also tell you if you missed something   tile counts are nice but i dont have every app pinned nor do i want it that way   just a history for one days notifications would be enough   it would be really nice to have a share task that i could pass a stream to in order to share an image   this task could bring up the same interface when i share an photo from my pictures library   it would make it simple to share photos to facebook and twitter if the user already has it setup   it would also make it possible to finally share photos via sms and email programmatically   examples google should be able to add google support to me people hubs   amazon should be able to integrate their cloud music seamlessly with music video hub   flickr should be able to integrate with picture hub   when searching in the market you should be able to open the app if already installed   please provide apis for call forwarding and other call management functions hold unhold swap conference etc   as a user i would like to be able to select songs that i have put on the device from my library to wake up to   as a developer i can only allow the user to choose from songs that i included with the app   the main work around i ve seen in the various alarm clock apps is to force the user to keep the app open over night which is not particularly awesome for battery life   add an option to customize the size of pictures uploaded to skydrive or send via mail   also add an option to autoupload full images tu skydrive and not only x px as preset on the lumia   right now you can start apps by holding down the windows button and saying start appname   it would be great if you could start an app while adding some instructions for example facebook show me messages office create new word document prime tv mark house season episode as watched   when holding my phone in one hand the palm of my hand just below my thumb come very close to the search button and a stretch to far can often send me off to the search function while i am texting or writing an email   is there any possibilty that these controls can somehow be made less sensitive or become a more mechanical click   the touchmove event is called only once when i move my finger across the screen   so i can t create complex html pages with a fixed header and a scrollable content   i will move the content per javascript but i can not because the touchmove event is not triggered   please implement the whole touchapi in the internet explorer and the webbrowser control   this is very important for mobile websites because iphone and android support this   emails are non editable while   enable picture password as in windows   deleting multiple for sms as email services   i am thinking about a sdk to allow me to create an account app   so like google facebook linkedin i want to create contacts calendar and access to message hub also writing messages with my account   marketplace upload of this kind should be more restricted to avoid problems   when i m reading a web page or other document i would find it incredibly useful to be able to jump to the jump of the document without endless swiping   if more elements one day   we cant see the other   it is slightly fustrating when one or two screenshots take longer to load and you cannot skip them while swiping through the images   like windows mobile and older version   currently you can only have the review page from the app list with the contextual menu   it will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general pr sentation screenshots the other users reviews   add capability to enter manual parametets for visual voicemail   currently in the all applications view tge jumplist appears only when there are more than apps   i have about apps and it is already difficult to find an app i think the jumplist shuld be always available   i believe scrolling should be improved   as sometimes when users are viewing a long document they sometimes might want to skip to the middle lower section   but scrolling seems to take a little long   thus this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll like every scrolls the scrolling speed will increase   ensure that we can buy clips movies and videos directly to wp without necessarily going through a pc   swipe from the top down with two fingers and flick through the last closed app as seen in windows   for instance email and messaging notifications could be silenced at night whilst call ringtones would function as normal   by benchmarking a developer a good developer work   it will encourage a developer to design better apps and it makes very easy for customers to choose the right apps ibstead of selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time   i see many developers can be benefited from text speech api   it can also bring in whole range of new apps for windows phone   in android for c dm google is providing free account and restrict number of messages per day   supporting windows authentication could be very usefull for example writing app that interacts with microsoft dynamics crm   currently only a defined set of extensions are supported for files to upload to skydrive using the new live api which limit really the usage of the api   for example my app can export csv files and i had to rename their extensions to txt to be able to upload them to skydrive using the live api   the language should be a search critreria for apps and games   the non english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and it is hard to find apps in my native language   if it s ms windows phone then make it as a part of the network   will see all shared resources   one shared folder can be set on phone device   easy to access and transfer on both sides pc phone   a business feature that would be really nice to have support for it the ability to tie into a voip network for voip phone calls the most common architecture is the sip session initiation protocol   so i would like the ability to configure a sip client that ties into our voip pbx and phone system so my wp would basically become my desk phone extension   the only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone s native phone functionality   if there is an app developer the a customer lukes i d be good to see everything that they have made   full or almost entity framework support including graphic class designer and interop with regular ef assemblies making it easy for developers to reuse model and persistence classes in the phone without the need to redo all the work in linq and some nasty tricks   it would be nice to have the deployment ability on my home pc able to be done wirelessly   this includes deploying in visual studio while developing and using the application deployment tool that is installed w the dev tools   for me the benefit would be that when i don t have a microusb cable handy i can still dev and deploy to my phone to try something out or deploy my friend s xap to my phone w o having to go find a cable first   this could be implemented via wifi of course since zune does wireless sync already or even bluetooth once we get bluetooth data transfer ability   wp lacks usb audio functionality with microsoft sync in cars   bluetooth playing audio is very limited   requesting mtp and mass storage functionality since competitors like iphone are able to do all this already with sync   in isolatedstorage image file can save to local medialibrary why not record wave file can not   too slow and too little possibilities   i took a while until i realized that i forgot staticresource within the style attribute   it s very hard to create application supporting multiple languages   give functionalities like resource manager as given by ide of other platforms   managing resources and folder structure for them should be made easier   make an eq for the mp player at the moment the volume it s really low   curently persons max   please enable pinning of the wi fi settings on start page   splashscreenimagelight and splashscreenimagedark would be great   after that it would be great to have the option to select an image from isolatedstorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed   make it so that a meteo style app would only need to adapt its ui to run on windows phone   it would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered   add movies and books would be an excellent addition for the system   enable speech command to play songs selection by saying play song name play artist play album   i believe the single most important thing for windows phone to be successful is that users in all countries should have the same services available   now when the marketplace has become available it would be great if users in other countries than us could migrate their accounts to the country they really live in   since windows phones are selling hot in countries like india browser should start displaying indian language characters   allow user to set different accent colors for different tiles   we should have small tiles instead of a long list of apps of which you downloaded like android and ios   an app should be able to publish a service that is disvoerable and consumable by other apps   for example if i have an app that can process images i want other apps to be able to dicover my app and submit photos for me to process   i would like access to a stream for music played via the media library   i wish the functionality to access and synchronize the public folder from exchange e g the public contacts or the calendar  this would enable live traffic aware apps  please try other formatting like bold italics shadow to distinguish titles subtitles from content  since computers were invented to save time i suggest we be allowed to upload them all in one zip file using numbering for the file names and the portal could place them in the right order  allow rearranging if the user wants to change them  add simd instructions for better use of arm neon instructions for math and games  also using a hot swapping code generator optimized machine code like hotspot in java does would also be very helpful to mitigate slow c# code  microsoft should seriously look into getting rid of symantec for all these payment stuff  i would be extremely useful in a variety of app types to be notified upon call started and ended events at least be able to check whether or not the device is being used for a phonecall  i would like to see informatin about the certification process in the dev center app  it would be nice to see at a glance if an app is featured in one of the markets  also i would be fun to have a record showing the featured markets and dates  make progressring control available for windows phone just like win  it would be great if the os moved on to the second third etc nfc record and tried to trigger off of them until there was a success  we need for our applications on each of the mobile platforms to be able to read data on a separate ndef records contained in an ndef message  provide process class apis like that for regular windows to develop lower level operations like task manager in windows please add the possibility the set price market distribution and trial mode existence individually for the xaps  add the ability to do memory profiling on background agent periodic as they are limited on memory and sometimes its too hard to catch memory leaks  either one has to use net to access a library or microsoft advises to do a net app with native code in a winrt component  don t limit us artifically just because you don t like native developers  these page templates should be updated to use the medium sized semibold font by default for the title text  task based operations would make the code much more clean and readable  add a boolean to cameracapturetask to indicate whether you want it to save the picture taken to be saved to the camera roll  please expose etw logging namespaces like system diagnostics eventing so that it is possible to log events from the windows app  currently the only way to take advantage of the direct manipulation in a xaml windows store app is by using a scrollviewer  instead of having a top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed to every phone anywhere create a new form of distribution where the results are randomized every time a user looks at the marketplace  highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating of the app dwindles  it seems to me that all good apps games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts and waiting to be featured just isn t worth it  maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it  it would be great to be able to use the wp emulator and surface emulator for that matter for mobility demonstrations i e when i deliver a dynamics crm demo i often nearly always want to include mobility scenarios on the same screen as the rest of the demo  it will even allow seamless migration to new hardware  i would like to ask microsoft to give us a tool option in emulator with which we can take screenshots once in one emulator and it will produce screenshots in all resolutions and all languages supported by our app  you have to run one emulator take screenshots close it and run another and so on  sharpdx proves that those key technologies can be made available to csharp i would suggest to either support the project or to provide your own interface  it would be more natural to allow the physical search key to activate the search function on the active application rather than loading bing which is rarely the goal  associate bound objects to data templates implicitly by type instead of explicitly by template name  for more information see data binding  on wp add optional support to hook these hardware keys press events for the lens plug in features hardware keys should include vol vol stage light press camera shutter stage deep press camera shutter  when an application has problems or when a problem is detected in advance by the developer until the publication of the correction version the client is without knowing what is happening it would be possible for microsoft to implement a communications resource developer for customers who have installed its application  read write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles based on week days time position etc  it s impossible to connect easily to ftp network i suggest to include it in the future sdk  i hope microsoft can open asia voice function fastest we need support special multitasking tasks like voip and im  please add the possibility to add your own spell check service or provide the data if a system wide one existed  if microsoft created some incentives like a free device blackberry did this and a free year of membership amazon did this it could drive a lot of developers to the platform which is crucial to the platform taking off  i would be a really nice gesture to have an option wich can put everything to the other side so when left handed people scroll they could also see the content  it would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the nmea file format either via file import export or using the files directly as a feed  currently you can only pin an album but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile that way you have easy access to a it  why shouldn t i as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries  for apps that synchronize or connect to networks sporadically it would be handy to have an easy way to detect if you are on a cheap connection so if wifi is connected or the device is connected to the web via usb  so suggestion is to add properties like iswificonnected and iscableconnected to devicenetworkinformation that execute fast  give developers good explanation what they do wrong and enforce good design  apps should take no longer than seconds to start and need to explain why they would take longer  please provide apis for call forwarding and other call management functions hold unholdswapconferenceetc  as a user i would like to be able to select songs that i have put on the device from my library to wake up to  thus this idea is actually for the developers to make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll like every scrolls the scrolling speed will increase  in addition the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder we need the ability for developers to add relevant tags to their app descriptions we then need the ability to search for apps with those tags tags should also be verified during app submission to ensure theyre relevant it will be pleasant to go the main page of the app in the marketplace to see the general pr sentation screenshots the other users reviews allow user to send video audio and more pictures in an mms now only one pic is supported allow access to raw data such as signal strength imformation to allow creation of indoor location positioning using available wifi bluetooth or cellular networks when no gps data is available  since windows phones are selling hot in countries like india browser should start displaying indian language characters  and a smart dialer can then be a full alternative to the built in phone app since the app also can have a quick button for goto the regular phone app whenever the user wants to do that  as an alternative to giving write access to calendar which can be hard to get a go on for security reasons let us at least open an appointment directly in the calendar app  signal strength directly impacts video playback experience  but reusing the operating system component saves us development effort and ensures it looks as expected as the operating system evolves  you can ask for a request but it s not clear what and when something will happen  with windows u have the ui app and the service app hosted locally may be the iis express used during local debug can be used  this new approach of developing applicaitons simlifies the ui development where developer get rid of learning other technologies like java scriptangularjquerystyle sheets and all those n number of scripts  typical problem here would be deployment installationupdate of the ui application to client machine but if we simplify this process of deployment like having the rules that the ui app should be only one obfuscated executable file it should not depend on reference more bonus points for it to be xaml standard compliant in addition this will allow a greater prominence of xaml standard and greater acceptance in the market and in the media  don t require developers to use the background task builder and background triggers just to activate an app in the background  a control that offers hour minute second selection would be helpful  add to collectionviewsource function pointer to get the group objects not just propertypath a datepickerflyout whose date is two way bound will update target to source but not source to target  when functions and fallbackvalue is used in an x bind at same time the parameter must match exactly  playback seamlessly between one media and another a control for visualizing and editing networks graphs and flow charts leave them alone  does not make sense that an idle task would be suspended for not being busy enough  making the task more busy to work around idle tasks being suspended would mean more battery usage kind of the opposite of what you want  microsoft wants us to build more connected app with project rome api  in we can extend brush by xamlcompositionbrushbase  it also annoys during development because now my solution has to have target platforms while it could just have one  what i want is to drag and drop a file then be able to get its full path and file name as stored on the disk and access it using standard c io file access functions such as fopen fread etc  i don t want to use xaml because it looks complicated it looks like it can reduce performance i m making d heavy directx based applications that need full performance  for example i drag and drop a bmp image my app compresses it and saves as png image automatically in the same folder with the same name  dual screen google card glass fulfill the function and make the application very attractive  we wanna to commuicate other app in desktop  not only other uwp but wpf application  i ve done the same tests in uwp mode using dxgi swap effect flip discard and results were the same slow as in win winapi  from what i see astc would be great for that have good quality but also small size looks like it has lot of format options so i could choose what i want  i m pretty sure the new treeview is not fall creators update dependent  map became unusable after phone update  resolvecompleted event comes after ten seconds  d lines on traffic layer are blurred jagged and looking bad  while nice looking uwp ui is not well suited for creating ui heavy classic applications think visualstudio autocad blender lobs with a lot of data that you would never want to use on tablet phone  if our isv uwp app also have this feature we can spent more time to trying the new feature and insider customer and testers can use it and we could got feedbacks  because if you currently assign a binding a visualstate setter as below it will resolve the value of the binding and assign that to the target while you would like to assign the binding itself  this will allow designs and implementations to change bindings depending on states and even help some states where some bindings are not required to be temporarily set to x null for performance handy in complex screens  we can see the entries added in the registry but client cannot access the interfaces  for example lets say i want to create shorthand for aligning a control inside relativepanel fully horizontal like alignhorizontalwithpanel  allows desktop apps to incrementally adopt ui innovations and creates a bridge to uwp for app ui  i tried the converted app using ime  we want to improve support google ime  i thinks it s not difficult to do since cortana for pc supports up to languages as listed on https support microsoft com en us instantanswers b e e eb db d e db f c b cortana s regions and languages you can verify this with the camerastreamcorrelation sample  the following streams are available on the pc  the following streams are available on the xbox  are there any plans to support skeleton tracking on the xbox  it seems such a shame that the new kinect drivers expose the kinect via this api and yet the exposurecontrol is marked as being not supported for the kinect  from the libfreenect library it seems entirely possible to tell the kinect not to do auto exposure  i expect that the content set directly the text to persist after closing the application  to me something that may cause a runtime crash and that the compiler clearly knows to flag should not a warning but an error  xbox dev mode companion work ipv please  make it really smooth to update code of a uwp app like you are already doing with the xaml part the app is automatically reloaded without being shut down and relaunched  a xaml designer for visual studio in windows  the control would allow for the use of the contact picker but allows for manual entry and deletion of contacts  to give the user a sense of consistency the file picker remembers the last location that the user navigated to and will generally start at that location  this is not always the best solution for example pretend you had a uwp app that asked the user to select a picture and a music file  i am migrating my app from windows desktop using core audio api to uwp using hopefully audiograph  we are exploring moving forward with uwp but currently there is no way to access the pipeline to add custom shaders and models like we do now in virtual earth with microsoft mappoint graphics d graphicsengine d and microsoft mappoint rendering d scene step  i m developing a java application so interop with c# is kinda tricky while interop shell api or c libraries is pretty easy and straightforward with jna  it is very difficult to create a custom richeditbox with all the basic features like text formatting bullets and numbering support for inking like onenote and also to support adaptive layout that s too much work for basic text editing  i m creating app using face detection  if we put the mkv in another service or server the video is reproduced but the connection with onedrive has been lost  it stops on the way  chinese and italian support have already been asked for  in some cases an access error may occur at the time of opening a file or it may be opened correctly  we want a solution  something seems to have changed with loggingchannel possibly default manifest code that handles the string message has changed around  fwiw preview versions of windows post anniversary update were showing the message correctly  i d like to have implicit datatemplates in uwp  currently i can only input plain text in toast notification input since the type does not support password  developers need to have good and deep understanding of how ui virtualization works on uwp app currently you can use the pivot or there are rd party vendors providing a tabcontrol  i m converting some wpf apps to uwp and i m missing a report control  please open up the base classes for inheritance and provide a sample how to create a custom virtualizing panel  without this uwp is more or less a toy because any customization requires that the app be deployed completely separately  this is only relevant for desktop uwp apps  you can at least provide any of these solutions  i d use this for my media phone playing groove  the panorama control is still the best control for my app and my users love it  updating the app to uwp is not possible without this control  currently there is no way to prevent menuflyout from closing when user click any of its items  i m not even sure if it is not a bug because setting args cancel in closing event is not working  support i o transactions on uwp platform as part of windows runtime api for file i o for example three quick touch strokes to scroll immediately to the top or bottom  really long lists and views are boring to scroll even at maximum scroll speed  keyboard have home end keys to scroll to top bottom but touch screen doesn t have same capability  but this library is fairly low level  that concept is painfully evident when using microsoft s edge browser and you want to browse various favorites menus  specifically excellent mouse support means that menus will support all the hover actions that menus currently enjoy in win applications  the current situation requires two mouse clicks to accomplish the same thing as a simple hover should  i don t know what the component should look like  it can happen that sometimes we do need a control to store a list of pages elements that looks like a pivot control but with a infinite list of pages elements  so i tried to find other ways such as excel access or sql server compact edition  so application would request secret api keys as needed from system provided secure storage  release appx shouldn t have secret keys inside and keys should be on windows store server and those keys would be requested from server on application install  another advantage is the developer already have a preview in design mode the idea would be to have a try button on every sample  this button will generate a ready to use visual studio project with the current sample  it seems that animated gifs disappear when application minimizes restores   allow the user to select items drag them around and resize them  we currently have a store app that works with our desktop app and it causes a great deal of confusion  if you need anything from me for any reason i will do what ever i need to do to improve our software for our users  as developer i want to create custom picker like date or time pickers you can t scroll at that point   in an xaml page there are some buttons and command bar buttons both of which have access keys set  i am working on porting an app that could calculate md checksums on a file  being an enterprise developer the advent of big data i believe the seadragon pivotviewer lastest binaries should be ported over to wpf uwp apps as it is a well needed tool  since we are preparing a custom control with the scrollviewer the look and feel is not nice  microsoft is loosing a huge market by not supporting a full net standard  evidently the mediacomposition saveasync api internally uses the storageapplicationpermissions futureaccesslists api which has a limitation of items  if you add more than clips created via mediaclip createfromimagefileasync the api will fail with this exception  an item must be removed before another item is added  additional information the maximum number of items for the access list has been reached  in case app is installed in sd card and notification uses custom audio file default notification sound is played instead of custom audio file  in the end developers have to use some workarounds to simulate old behavior  you can see that even apps list in w m simulates old behavior instead of default one  when using fm radio i have my headphones plugged in  this would make replying to messages etc  i know it s not possible at the moment specially with all the hardware limitations but if you guys really are working on a surface phone bringing visual studio to it will be so huge  the problem is the output port names are enumerated by the uwp api as just midi and not the name of the port as defined when they were setup  reaper and other desktop programs are displaying the proper name  including windows h shouldn t generate compile warnings even the extra ones  that would make all the users happy  hololens let s you render on backbuffers stereoscopic but it s hard to know if the output is correct because the emulator shows just one frame  there is a bug in uwp where special characters are interpreted as letters when using multi layered keyboard layout like the german neo layout  it s also a total annoyance when working with data that require handling of lots of special charecters like json and xml data  looking forward to the progress you re doing d with project rome i can discover devices of others connect with them and launch apps or leverage app services once consent has been established  this feature is implemented in the accessory api which is restricted to only smart watch makers  this would allow them to know that additional awesome features are there  the windows display language of my computer is set to en us because i am an app developer and most app problems and solutions are written in english  such functionality is common to music apps in google play store apple store blackberry world  in most cases such apps can be ported to uwp platform and because they are coming from a posix linux the network api is bsd sockets as well as some complex network communication libraries can be used to support this or that network oriented functionality  currently the network data flow is boroken once app goes into background or screen is switched off  can in app purchases made available to windows store for business  these channels are not accessible with the current audiograph api s  it has support for linux and i think windows should gain support too  and the dac folder is empty  hello dev team  in the app settings you can disabled the swipe open or make the swipe in detection area wider if the user s phone makes getting close to the screen edge difficult  so there should be a way to either swap out style xaml rsourcedictionary files and or pieces of more any feedback is appreciated thanks john  xaml apps can detect it but there is no equivalent winrt api for js apps  my html perfectly fine in windows but not in windows mobile  as an information this is the xaml control that contain the complex attribute property  in my opinion this feature is really fundamental much more important to me than many new features that appears regularly  according to the documentation the proper way to handle input in a store app is to create a coreindependentinputsource from another thread by calling swapchainpanel createcoreindependentinputsource  devices with touch input are the ones that suffer the most from this bug since they come with weak gpus  devs have to chose either low responsiveness or low performance  the application will exit  having an api allowing getting the color of the pixels under a pointer eventually throttled async and only when having pointer capture on would increase the expressiveness of the creation tools in uwp applications  i am manually having to keep a list of these when it would be easily managed in the dashboard if the status properly reflected this  the current status only seems to show in progress if the app has never been put in the store before  meanwhile the perf counters are difficult to associate with a specific application requiring the request queue be named which httplistener does not do and netsh called to find url group ids to use for correlation  i did a research on audioframeoutputnode it is strange that it often generate audioframe without any audio data the audioframe s duration property is miliseconds but the relativetime property is not  for example a user send us a feedback to ask a windows rt version of our app but now we are focused on windows so we need to be clear that we read his feedback but it s not on our roadmap  after that the age rating questionnaires stop submitting when you press submit  an example of this an application as a node in an internal media network would be something along the lines of audiobus for ios  extrapolate the above capabilities to audio allowing on the fly add remove interconnectable reroutable audio nodes virtual interface devices to which apps devices would attach to instead of attaching only to hardware interfaces  same for video not only making desktop window screen capture a breeze and naturally handle by the os it would also allow the creation of virtual screens resource permitting of course for desktop expansion mirroring outputting them to a video input recording apps usb or even to a dlna receiver screens  this would allow the user through the os to detach an app media output from its default interface audio midi card screen window and re attach it to another app or device input  what if we will exchange apps reviews  i like the ease of the app and recommend this app to all  i have largely ignored this is the past because it was minimal but someone is finding good success with it so they re hammering everyone  personally i m getting a day from different source email addresses  removing the support email from the webpage would not hinder the user as they can see it via the windows store app   a user is at lunch viewing their sensitive documents  they switch to their email app our application detects active state change and auto logs out  they finish their food and leave but forget their phone on the table   at this point a perpetrator is able to take the phone open the recent apps section and now can see whatever our client was looking at   user is at their desktop observing files gets up and makes the app inactive minimizes or moves to back  we begin a timer to auto log out   a perpetrator is able to hover over the taskbar item and see the last screen drawn whether or not the user logged out  sorry if i sound bitter but i must say it s very frustrating developing for w mobile at the moment even if the you get good reviews the chance of them being displayed in the store is very slim due to the version fragmentation  as i understand it insider reviews that aren t on the slow ring are removed even worse they re deleted permanently from even the developer dashboard  people took time to write thoughtful reviews and they re simply deleted  i ve started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them i ve had over fifty star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again  i see the point that insiders shouldn t bring down the ratings of the app if the os is to blame but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews  old windows phone retain their status of being the most highly rated just because of this  what s the point of having a rule if that means there s too few reviews and no point for most people to post reviews at all  i m not quite sure what a good solution is you cold allow only reviews for fast insiders but i guess that might skew reviews too positively  or why not let the text review stand even if the rating doesn t count  as it is getting an accurately impressions of apps through reviews doesn t seem feasible  the caller does not have the required permission to perform this operation  iot introduced the windows system processlauncher for starting arbitrary programs like process start in net  note when executed dns client service crashes comment out the textattributes line and note service does not crash i have bound the ispaneopen of my splitview to a property in my viewmodel  this works nicely except when the splitview is in overlay mode and the user presses a hardware back button on the phone  in this case the splitviewpane gets closed as expected but it does that by seemingly overwriting the binding on ispaneopen and instead setting it directly to the value false  the effect is that the panel can never be opened again as my code will do this by setting the vm property to true but the binding was already lost  in practical terms you are forced to make a ui technology diversion to implement new functionality  xaml doesn t look a tempting option because not useful for mobile or web and needed controls usually implemented in javascript first at a application architectural level porting winforms to html js favours an entirely new application which follows an understood accepted architectural pattern then re implement old functionality  so imagine the app in question was one written by an ex employee in in vb net with deep domain knowledge targeting users with similar domain knowledge for a specialist task with no design documentation beyond a description of a manual process it replaced  well this is the norm and for all it s wrong s its there  never had budget assigned in the first place and it s used by people who are all busy  given the architectural barrier is the killler i don t believe there is any feature of gdi which cannot be expressed in html  the ui may not adhere to good gui design principals it s performance may suck but it probably won t  but it s users can start it and it will look and act the same as it did before arcane controls and all  the architecture of a modern html appliication has much more in common with gdi and a windows message loop than it does with xaml  things like redux essentially go out of their way to be like a message loop to avoid race conditions through async operations  for microsoft this would i believe solve a massive developer stumbling block even allowing winforms controls to potentially be integrated in html ui s  so imagine the app in question was one written by an more microsoft finally developed a library able to handle nfc devices  unfortunately the library is only able to get the ndef messages and doesn t give the uid of the card  is there a reason why this uid is not saved in the proximity device once the nfc card is read  but it has no similar property on uwp s api  you reproduce this on mobile build system  currently there is no way to attach debugger to already running process via attach to process on mobile  and sometimes bad bugs like deadlocks happens  and its real pain to investigate them since usually they happen without debugger and on release builds  windows mobile is like back box you can t get full access to  frankly speaking i m surprised that it was not there from the very beginning  all that happens without any real user attendance which makes those triggers useless  in wm there was an unattended power state for that situation and there was a way to detect real user interaction with the device  current behavior of systemtrigger useraway and userpresent is unexpected  phone is sleeping with screen turned off some event occurs sms incoming call toast  usernotificationchangedtrigger fired userpresent trigger fired after some short timeout screen goes off this is my personal favourite mobile file open picker the app suspends but it cannot be debugged  all sorts of surprises can happen with a complex app  before uwp currentculture reflected the regional settings format and currentuiculture reflected the display language  we shouln t have to relly on workaround like this one https www pedrolamas com cultureinfo changes in uwp  it would be a lot like facebook messenger s chat heads  so many things could be done with it  i found that phonetriggertype enum includes useful triggers except the trigger when a call is received  torch api doesn t work in lumia with windows phone support such as lumia  currently uwp have less readable grayscale font smoothing  it makes uwp apps look worse than desktop apps on standard dpi screens  sometimes compass getdefault returns null and compass stop working in all apps  to solve i need to restart the phone  in the following msdn magazine article it is mentioned that there are some limits for voice command deffiniton files  i use windows sapi quite intensively for an application i have built and many grammars are easily much bigger than the limits imposed by cortana  this makes it a bit tricky to port the recognition engine part of the application away from sapi and towards cortana since sapi provides more powerful capabilities for larger sets of commands  unfortunately i am not going to know all uri s the cookies are in without tracking every single domain visited which is what i currently have to do  i do this so i can clear all cookies  an api that would take minutes for someone to write up and save me a lot of coding is or secondary to that a deleteallcookies or clearcookies api as that is the only reason i need to get all of them and i can t think of any other use cases to retrieve all cookies  happy to go either way  user interaction depends on it  searched up and down to get this done in windows no success  similar has been accomplished in pre  used win ce where ms granted more access to source code  pedestrianfeaturesvisible can be toggle only if mapstyle is set on road  currently when using a controlchanneltrigger with httpclient you cannot send a https request without the application getting terminated by the system  i tested using https and to my surprise it does work with the debugger attached no exceptions get thrown so it is implemented  however termination occurs when the application is not connected to the debugger  audiograph created with custom desiredsamplesperquantum ignores it and uses default ms quantum  depending on hardware you may hear gaps right after start or you may need load cpu with some additional work like scrolling ui or running some work in background threads  i guess it is result of extremely short quantum size ms even switching between threads could take more time and too low buffer length quants but it could be just some synchronization issue  slider renders to extreme right value instead of zero i have an app where i use a custom title bar by extending my view into the title bar area  then i also use code like this to allow a custom element to support dragging of the window  this all was implemented pre anniversary update  while all this works fine a bug was introduced in the anniversary update where the title bar returns zero for height systemoverlayrightinset and systemoverlayleftinset now  i confirmed that in pre anniversary update these properties would return values like for height and for systemoverlayrightinset  the use of the file type filter makes no sense when you are picking a folder and it s not menioned in the documentation suppose we have an app with two modes like zune normal and mini  in the mini mode the app only presents the indispensable and small elements on the window  i know maybe it s not at the microsoft s priority list but i believe we can somehow make it available  but that would be nice  we do like to build universal windows apps  at the moment it is possible to install to the application install directory but the files there cannot be altered by the application  if the application copies the files to the application data folder after installation as done in my work around it cannot delete the original files in the installation folder by this having two versions  after the anniversary update the store shows default the ratings of current version  this is very annoying for developers of good and populair apps  a potential user viewing in the store will most likely make his judgement to download based on the number of reviews and quality of reviews especially since the windows store does not show the total number of downloads  so for app publishers this will be a reason to keep app updates to an absolute minimum in order to get as many ratings as possible  or at least last days  i want to know it to make custom title bar that looks exactly as defult one except with my controls  i m able to get systemaccentbrush but i can t get actual window title bar s color becouse it depends on this show accent color setting  i ve already asked the forum where you can find the detailed description on the issue  if often mis classify the direction  p s i didn t know where to post this but since the library is in windows media ocr namespace i put it under media using resources in a datatemplate worked just fine before  now that i ve upgraded to anniversary and installed the newest sdk and tools the newest visual studio update it doesn t work as expected at all  this will crash on instantiation because somehow the viewmodel object is null when the bindings are updated which was definitely not the case in previous versions and surely not the expected behavior  if i replace the x bind with a binding it will run but if using the datatemplate for multiple objects for example in a gridview the resource will have the same value for all instances which makes it really pointless  some apps have such poor startup perf that ngen is must  or since this is a store app will the standard background ngen work for wpf apps  i do not like the recent change in the dev center  first of all it shows cumulative acquisitions rather than for a specified amount of time making it hard to compare which apps people like more if an app has been available longer of course the cumulative acquisitions will be higher  also being able to see only some of the apps at the same time is very frustrating  currently it is part of a sample  as simple as clickonce publishing  i do not want to convert msis right now the new devcenter offers the ability to sort by apps by included markets base price and last modified  i can see it when i go to definition on serialdevice  in order to break my code s dependency on actual hardware so i could automate my tests i had to reinvent the wheel  by keeping this interface internal i was forced to re create the interface mostly and create a wrapper around serialdevice that implemented it  that s a lot of code to write when the interface already exists  after my application open office document programmatically in background link to it appears in quick access area in file explorer  it s not good thing because it s not needed to share this with users  enabling a custom provider in the realtime etw tracing page of windows device portal shows no details other than the timestamp for each event  i ve been using perfview and that works great and shows the event details payload keywords level etc  i was just hoping to use the portal for realtime monitoring but it doesn t appear to be working correctly  allow to developers create a custom keyboard  if immediate approval is not possible then apps that have been published should be immediately available  windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and request the conent consumers and content providers lack of interaction makes it less exciting  now it work but the the header of first group is not displayed  if the phone doesn t have an accurate location simply return what it does have  me and two friends of mine created an app that won in a windows hackathon held by microsoft cyprus  so as far as i can tell the combination splitview pane pivot is the cause for this problem  i submitted my word game to the apple app store  please don t neglect this suggestion i am not saying to copy anyone  this way the already paid for g g wifi network cable etc   if before calling the method i remove the attendee it won t crash not just send a mail somewhere  could you make an option in the sdk installer for just the tools  currently this is not possible because when trying to add custom headers to the content using the below code  please make it available also for us developers here in kenya there is what i consider a security issue in uwp applications that i feel should be addressed  best regards leo  not sure if this has any relevance  i am working on location based apps  i am using mapicon to show user current location  now i want to allow the user to drag that mapicon but there is not an event to that  when creating a login page i found that when placing the focus in the user name field the header and textbox added an additional box around the field to indicate focus  however on the password box the field focus does not occur  since webview lacks support for manipulation events it acts as a huge gesture eater which doesn t let its parent controls like scrollviewer flipview to take control of gesture like scroll swipe etc  it becomes impossible to use a webview along with other xaml elements in the same view  if selectionmode is none in a listview its really hard to know which item that is in focus  also setting which item is in focus is hard as well  if there are some better way please let me know  the ways i found feels a bit clumsy  i work around this by checking device family  but the modern winrt network api which is based around streamsocket and the corresponding streamsocketcontrol do not provide an option to enable tcp timestamps support  which is not future proof  yes i know if we re c developers we can use the traditional winsock api setsockopt can do what we need but that will tied us to the old self manage threads model which is not pleasing  rfc tells the story in much greater detail  i have an app in the store to make a live tile clock  i checked with multiple clock tile apps in the store and they all have this same fundamental issue   blank or app logo on tile until tile notification refreshes  something like what htc shipped with their windows phones  in an effort to minimize overhead may the system settings could allow for only one selected clock app to be running  right now creating an isolated environment fails for some installers  i was able to run the converter on build and  however on build i got this error  we ve got the clean un install but no app level resets  do people really launch their app and then get their file they wanted my strong experience is people find their file and then let the file type associations work for them  the fta s are meant to be user changeable currently i have to do a request to the server to check the certificates extract the public key and verify it s ok  currently i cannot access the handshake of the httpclient where the ssl pinning verification should be done  was scratching my head wondering what was going on until i enabled verbose msbuild output  seems if a specified layoutfile in appxpackagefilelist is missing a file copy is skipped and no other output occurs  the vsdproj extension doesn t immediately load this value into the project property window packagelayout text box until you change your configuration from its current value to something else and back again  web view is not supporting ms appdata local uri for rendring images into web pages that are hosted in installed location  a gatt notification arrives from a sensor  we only get seconds to do something with it  we want to tag the location but gps takes longer than that to lock  it s virtually impossible to tell how much you will be getting paid in paid apps and iaps  the reserved amount updates daily but that s never the actual number paid out  for example if you see in reserve there needs to be a way to know that you might expect about of it to be paid while the rest is held over  the uwp provides a couple of options to access files and folder  unfortunately access is only guaranteed via storagefile storagefolder  this makes it hard to port existing codes that make intensively use of the other api  right now attempt to do it using win or stdio will result in permission denied which is total nonsense basically saying that ok we give you these api options but we dare you to try to use the classical one  this will make it possible to have continuous deployment process for the platform  give the public yet another reason why the windows dev platform is the best  currently we customizing titlebar background and foreground but border is not  sometimes i only have a storagefile and i would like to launch the explorer to display that file  to do so i need access to the file s storagefolder and pass that to launchfolderasync  i am using the raspberry pi with the nxp nfc modul  several card standards are possible  companies and public services using encrypted cards use a key to read data card id confidential data  we have a server cloud backend as part of our product  each costumer may run a different version of this backend software  the sole purpose of us using the sfb is to limit what apps users can see and install  actually the list of installed apps are useless is terrible just shows one app at a time xaml supports inking so that a user can handwrite directly into a textbox using ink which is then converted automatically into text  this was demo d in one of the apps at the build event in london  actually initially i constructed the msi by placing the folder in the documents folder but the centennial does not install it there but in the vfs  it will be hard for the user to find these kind of folders too  i am adding some screenshots too  you can install those android apps yourself  now a promotional codes allows his owner to get paid aplication from the store only by  discount codes are a very important marketing too wich is overlooked in the store currently if an app developer submits an update to an exsiting lob app the update bypasses the business store and the app is automaticallyupdated  this gives enterprises the control of when the updated app is deployed to their users i e so that is does not conflict with other updates etc support hybrid html cordova applications and windows mobile rdlc report viewer with report designer in winform apps was the easiest way to get the job done  but after i deploy the sample code at my phone arm it throw this exception  sample code in onedrive here  that s the thread in msdn form  if you try to open an file by file type association linked filetype then you will have no file access to most of the open file with this app scenarios  the only way is to grant file and folder permission is by the folder picker which itself have no default folder parameter  so this is really terrible for an app  currently it is possible to do it using winium but not possible to do using winappdriver  the file explorer in device portal lets you look at dat files the ones where localsettings and roamedsettings are stored but there s no way to edit them  ssml is not fully supported  our users occasionally experience freezes in our current high data volume c# net app that i believe is because of garbage collection  having to move to c for this would mean a drop in productivity for our developers  should show temperature data on device portal  user can t be expected to keep the window maximized  this makes sense for phones and tablet mode but for desktop and dedicated use devices it s just a limitation  iot supports a single app so it isn t affected but windows mobile is  issues like this make it hard to use uwp in business use cases  if uwp is to take over for win this is basic requirement  we re trying to build a solution based on windows mobile that runs a single assigned access app  i can use fiddler on my desktop to view my network traffic  i run the converter on powershell but it can not finish the work though it doesn t report any problems  in other works it keeps running state here is the complete log  attempting to choose the most recent one compatible with your version we have several instruments that implement an api via soap on linux that presents as a wcf service  unfortunately we can t create uwp apps because there is no support for the custom wcf binding which is needed to talk to these instruments  i d love to do it  centennial cmd line arguments  appx shortcuts do not support command line arguments  not sure if this is the right place but it seems that the makeappx commando doesn t like rels xml files as added by the vs setup  i ran it multiple times yout to find the reason but it crashed with this errors every time when it got to a rels file  just like an user have right for review so should developers be able to respond to each and every reviews submitted to the store  if an user plans to opt out from a response from developer do not email the user a response but still allow a response to made publicly visible  needless to say why because the current implementation is being exploited to submit false reviews and not allowing the developers to respond  since application insights for mobile is discontinued soon the dev center analytics will be broken  actually exceptions thrown by uwp apis are just painfully awful  too many empty stacktraces too many an error as occurred too many approximative and vague exceptions  i understand that the unnecessary javascript made winrt insanely complex to design but please  exceptions are there for a reason not to just be an error has occurred message  there is a cordova plugin with admob for windows phone but there is still no plugin adcontrol and specific mediation to cordova  admob does not release windows phone support and has no roadmap to do it  smaato has already supported w but there are not plugin developed yet  this will help us bring our apps to windows phone and windows universal platform  system diagnostics process start path with path pointing to a folder or a html file or a txt file etc results in the only solution found was to use startinfo with explorer exe for filename and path for arguments  soemthing gone wrong in one of the latest builds currently i m workong on and after picking a file or folder the app crashes  sometimes it returns for a second but remains inresponsive  evertying seemed to work just right few builds before now many users report me problems  while debugging if you click suspend the app and vs will hang and after a while your phone will likely restart  today there is a handler for newwindowrequested to create new window but there seems to be no way to handle window close call from javascript for example  uwp single page app with webview as only control  when app is activated webview control gets focus and receives corresponding event but the content of the webview eg html does not get a focus and document hasfocus remains false  if user clicks on the html document hasfocus becomes true and webview receives lostfocus event  expected behaviour webview focus is in sync with document hasfocus  it seems to me that the base image runs some sort of firstrun setup everytime a centennial installation is executed  wouldn t it be better to call this firstrun setup once and apply it to the base setup  give us a print function for the uwp webview control  problems mediaplayer class play audio will delay s   audio file length less than or s will not playing  so i did some research i decompile one of those app and found it used mediaplayer class for playing audio filethen i wrote a demo and the same problem did occur  but i don t have enough evidence to prove that  it will be great appreciated that anyone see this will help me vote it up so microsoft can aware and fix itit is really important for those who learning english and looking up vocabularies frequently in daily life  thank you very much  i currently use the codedui testing framework as it allows me to logon to ie as a different user password  the sites that we test use windows authentication and asp net impersonation as they run on an intranet  we do not use basic authentication so cannot pass credentials on the url  this means that we are forces to use the codedui framework  windows app store categories has tremendous potential to interact and request  scenario we have a red that s an integral part of our identity  our users are asking for transparent tiles including primary tile  this leaves us in a bad place where we have to either sacrifice our branding or don t provide the required functionality proposed solution have an independent color setting for store specific branding currently didn t support unicode  i made a simple test code using korean language  and exception is raised  if we look at appx the new installation mechanism as a much saner version of app installation then the more applications it allows the better  my example an interactive screen sharing app  as far as i know this wouldn t be possible with centennial as it exists today but these kinds of apps are still valuable  centennial takes big steps towards that but i d like to go even further  not just months  i have a style targeting a fonticon control with a setter for the fontfamily  the open source platform ionic has such a market place and i think it s great  there exist a couple of uwp libraries but their purpose is not to show beautifully designed apps implementing the material design principles of the framework  as of now uielement clip accepts only rectanglegeometry in uwp applications  when uwp app has a splash screen with transparent background color declared in the app manifest desktop renders the accent color while phone renders the background color  i belongs to india and want to register my self in microsoft developer  i need to pay life time registration fee for this  when try to pay my fee there is only one option to make payment which is credit card  no more options are there  i do not have credit card therefore unable to make payment  i have all these things but does not have only credit card and cause of only this minor reason i am unable to make payment  when games get released on steam valve promotes the game for free by displaying it to mln users  earlier there was option to cumulative download of all the app and now there is now way i can see total number of app downloads till date  a report specially to know how many users have updated to a specific version of the app  on some of my computers i only need the tools for phone deployment such as winappdeploycmd  i don t code on all these machines i only need the tools  i copied the tools out separately and they are only mb  they work fine without the headers and libraries installed  this feature is really usefull in messaging apps  is it the right place to report bugs to microsoft  why do we need to call bug reports new ideas   administrator i am listing this one as a bug because i consider it a existing security issue that can be exploited at present but please feel free to categorize it however you see fit as always  therefore malicious parties could use any url location they would like under their control for the webauthenticationbroker authenticate calls to phish the credentials of users of this process as users do not see understand the url in which the process is loading the content for the authentication workflow and therefore cannot validate its authenticity  for context here are the steps as i understand them that can be used to exploit this process  that is where your creativity comes in  if it works pass the user on to the real sign in page or better yet simply set cookies on the user s session that makes it seem all is ok   rule planet earth with your new found powers ok i made this one up  for reference this is based on a thread started in the msdn forums which you can see here for additional information  thank you for any consideration  adding developer revenue or iap price info to response will allow developers to receive accurate data about their income in requested period  so i can get the sid or the groups of the user  most companies want to control the access of the user by the active directory  the enterprise application uses this information whether a user got access or not  please help us out  we are an isv who live in out of the united states  when we want to set app price dev center offers by us dolloar for base price   previous version of dev center was able to set by local currency  this is degraded  usd is not familiar for us   we use different local currency basically  there is no conversion list between usd and local currency  microsoft sometimes changes conversion rate due to foreign exchange conversion rate  because of this it is hard to find expected price by our local currency  conversion rate seems not constant because of this it is hard to find our expected price  i have certificate in user storage and app storage with same issuer and subject but with different eku fields  certificate in user storage is filtered out and that s the one i m interested in  i need to check if it s installed already or not and function checking it returned false because of this and i ended up installing new one every time  and none of those duplicates are listed  today the ui designer could not work because it cannot parse the node  currently the rates reviews user submitted in win insider preview will be disabled later  and if devs respond to that reviews it will also be deleted  this is ridiculous behavior for both users and devs  if ms will disable rates reviews sent from win ip disallow users to rate review   improvements to windows store apps and games visibility currently it is not possible to export the app download statistics automatically via an api in the windows dev center  currently microsoft doesn t have any specific support for beacons  beacons are the next generation rulers in the market  as a windows developer i don t see a good future for windows here when ever i contact any manufacturer of beacons they basically hesitate to support windows because the limitation in the windows featurest  we don t have any separate library for beacons  beacon also considered as normal bluetooth device  currently i can only read that too has many limitations i can t communicate  this is a big drawback  we expected this will be solved in windows but not yet  till now many clients for my company left out windows and they moved to ios and android  if this is going to continue then windows will face huge drawback  i have raised many questions related to this in community forum  there was no input from there  i m not sure you guys will have a look on this quickly or not  even if you have a look i m not sure about your priority  windows wings are currently cut down in this area  in wpf you can use textures and patterns for your app background with the tilebrush class  since imagebrush inherits from tilebrush there is a missed property tile  in windows forms it is easy to have users print without a dialog and to code the printer output to use a specific paper bin  this functionality is missing in uwp  one of our applications has users print checks from a shared check printer with the check stock in tray   users as sites do this and it has worked fine in vb for the last years  now that we want to upgrade the applications to a modern environment we find that uwp does not do it and wpf makes it hard leaving only winforms  right now you can not register them forever  for example the pro extension stands usually for a better version of the same app from the same developer  but if someone else uses this it is misleading  i am working in multinational company it is always the accent color and cannot be changed  currently the windows blog commenting system suffers from a myriad of problems  conversely with disqus you get the following benefits  a blog post has been created to discuss these issues at length and you can read that here  thank you for any consideration and dialogue around this idea  this is ridiculous  also and perhaps more importantly developers need this  do you know how many hoops i have to jump though to make an app that simply takes photos and puts them on a network location too many  it is crazy that such basic functionality is not currently supported almost every device on the planet supports this other than windows phone  what makes this even more important is the fact that it is already supported in uwp apps when they are running on desktop laptops and tablets  but the same file picker on phone is just missing this universal functionality  i am having difficulty testing an in app purchase that is successful with microsoft s servers yet somehow my app never receives that success message  we have made a private test app and we use real money to test iap  this makes it hard to test when there is a cost to every test we perform  i would prefer to be able to test iap hundreds of times without having to attempt to get a refund for thousands of dollars  this is currently not possible to test using currentappsimulator  apple and google also provide such a sandbox environment where iap does not cost real money  i have a parent application that stores files within app space  now when i wish to open a file the launcher asks me to choose a target application  myapp has a file abc pdf  on opening the file abc pdf from myapp the launcher provides a list of applications that can open this file  assuming i choose pdf reader i want myapp to know when pdf reader has closed or stopped accessing my file i e abc pdf code analysis will often warn if you expose a properlty as a uri using a string type can be ignored but ca is giving a fair warning here i feel  i would like to see system uri supported natively by the runtime when making a binding like this  also as a side note the conversion from string breaks throws an exception if a bound string is null or empty however a string that is non empty and not a valid uri doesn t throw  however if you have a pin on your system it treats that as a biometric device as well  this is not what the documentation indicates  userconsentverifier should not treat a pin as a biometric device  right now when displaying online web page in windows webview the hsts security feature is not working  also the webview allows scripts from any source to load even though the page is loaded via https  see these pages for testing hsts and mixed content  i need support for ios the actual app has a lot of problems more like angularjs style  the old one is to verbose  unfortunately the glyph activity is never displayed on the tile  but when i m using any other glyph such as alarm alert attention it is properly displayed  thanks and best regards we are migrating an application from windows to windows  the first problem that we encountred is that in winrt enables to add an service reference of wcf and in uwp is not yet implemented  currently it s a mixture of some taxes are collected by ms some have to get paid by the developer  as a smaller business this is a huge effort and only theoretically possible  as far as i am informed the competition apple app store google play does this aswell  also ms used to collect more taxes than nowadays  look at this old feature request quoting an older developer agreement  it states any current member country of the european union which includes e g  nowadays jan th the dev agreements lists austria as a country which the developer has to collect the taxes  austria price being selected is the final sale price and includes any applicable taxes  i need it to keep the app title bar background is the same with accent color  on windows mobile for mobile connections calling getsignalbars on a mobile connection always returns even if the bars displayed by the system are any other value  it s working on wifi connection and on both type of connections on windows  is this a bug or something changed in w m  maxpath is giving me a severe headache lately  i ve been trying to compile some stuff and the compiler is necessarily creating processes with enormous arguments  everything would be fine but maxpath is too short to let it succeed  this is the only reason i ve got to switch to linux as i m not in a position to change maxpath or rewrite the way the compiler calls processes  please microsoft help  the generated bindings code is very large and not easy to follow  further it doesn t even exist until compilation and even then isn t visible to the user in vs  need timeout on read from streamsocket just like with old net sockets and serialport  now you have destroy the complete connection if a device on a bluetooth serial connection does not respond  while this makes no sense at all  there nothing wrong with the connection it is just a serial device not responding  javascript provides a history api with which you can manipulation certain aspects of the browsing history  for example history replacestate replaces the url of the current website in the browsing history  however it is not possible to detect these changes in webview without injecting javascript to replace the funtion calls  this solution is quite hacky and a lot of work about of my apps can not be found in the store  i have about apps and around are visible  even if i click on the developer name it still does not show all my apps  if i do a deep link then yes it find the apps and you can download them but it wont find them with keywords or app name  this is the same issue for all windows stores  every version of windows does not show my apps  i actually had one of my apps appear and then disappear a day later  this is unacceptable and is a strong deterrent to creating apps for windows  phone phone windows and windows  in browser deployment was an excellent feature of silverlight  while most organizations will allow in store apps it s still going to be very inconvenient to deploy apps through the app store for many reasons  firstly deployment in the app store requires rigorous testing etc from microsoft when the app users won t even be the general public  secondly we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers  read email access locally is very important to create professional and amazing apps for uwp apps please allow us to achieve this  we need set it in codes  http request includes get or post request url and body  while android and ios can do it  after changing to fullscreen and back the position of the window is wrong and not to influence right  i just found that reading the property of system comment from a file doesn t work on windows  i used storagefile properties getdocumentpropertiesasync to read the properties of a file that has comment but documentproperties comment is a empty string  same problem happens to windows explorer set a new comment then apply to the file but when you read again there s nothing  currently windows os decides the best internet connection and uses it automatically if i have more than one connection like wifi and network cable  uwp still lags all features of regular ado to connect to any db  using ef will only provide direct access to sqllite and not regular dbs  ms shall change ef to allow db connectivity via batch data return like return records at a time instead of select returning entire db table data in one shot  it appears there is a enter file name even when selecting an existing file using filesavepicker on uwp mobile  it seems to work as expected on desktop  you can see my original question on msdn forum below  winjs was designed prior to es  some of the capabilities are now provided by es such as classses would not have to be provided by winjs  edge browser vs and vs code already provides support for es  unfortunately it is also bug infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in  the solution is open sourcing windbg and related tools dbghlp windbg extensions etc which will allow the community to fix and improve what the rather small team at microsoft doesn t manage to  at the moment it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his microsoft account just to create app packages  i have posted my st application on windows store with keywords  for eg in publisher name or in application name whole word partial word and so on  the app knows that it is a totaly new clear situation scenario user save a file app is closed directory is deleted renamed next time dlg save file  currently it s difficult to do some of these things  nesting uicontainers inside of a richtextblock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text  inexplicably the uwp does not include the wpf wrappanel that was introduced nearly years ago  there are other panels in the uwp that do something similar like the wrapgrid but this doesnt work well if the items are variable size  one simple example where the wrappanel is essential is when displaying a tag cloud  there appears to be no way to deploy an app to a windows emulator outside of manually doing so in visual studio  without that we have no means to wrap our own tooling to launch and install built apps to the emulator  oddly with windows tooling installed and windows sdk we can actually see the list of windows emulators listed in the appdeploycmd output and need to do some post filtering to separate the and emulators  so currently we can use the tooling to get the list of emulators but if we try to deploy to them they ll start up but app deployment will fail  today i opened the windows dev account payout report i found up my advertising and my purchased app already separate into two  why this happen  i developed the app bizview a google analytics client with the same features of official google analytics app in the android store  this question is not because bizview is my own app the question is for all developers that works hard  after some diagnosis i found that the issue is caused by the api not handling pdf files encrypted with aes encryption that the later acrobat versions use  when drag dropping files folders onto universal apps the read only attribute is set making it impossible to edit those files folders  after all drag drop is a conscious user interaction like a picker and does not happen without their knowledge  apis do not support the configuration of the window background colour  this means that if like groove music an app uses a non white background a noticable section of white appears when a window is dragged to a new size  the link above is a sway that explains my suggestion better than i can do so here  i sincerely hope it makes a difference unfortunately neither the smartcard class nor the smartcardprovisioning class nor any other related class provides a means of retrieving the friendly name later  allow third party apps to manipulate dom elements  it looks as if the return value of  windows system power energysaverstatus regardless of a threshold set in the energy saver settings  looks like a bug  i m using a lumia device with windows mobile build  could someone please have a look into this it is frustrated for a devoloper then an app is nt show in any category and the app can only find per direct search by name  i have released several versions of the app yet i cannot find the number of new users or the number of existing users who have upgraded to the new app version in the dev center  i hope i can set my app price is but i can t now  currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using scheduledtoastnotification  but this is simply not an elegant solution  all win mac linux have api s to do so but uwp doesn t  when you have a text editor with unsaved changes the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing  this is not possible on uwp  today i have run into a problem with combobox control  the issue can be easily reproduced  i have two rows and two columns  left column takes as much space as possible and i place the combobox into the right column  i populate the combobox with a few items and run the app  i maximize the window open the combobox popup selection menu minimize and i see the popup moved to the middle of the window  showat show the flyout with the size width defined in the style however showatasync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style  i think its a bug  i would prefer it return a boolean or an enum with the fail reason  probably when the location is outside the camera frustum  currently we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of map actualwidth and map actualheight  if the point is outside we have to divide the result by rawpixelsperviewpixel  a point with a location near the top right corner of the map and inside the map will have an offset of  if the location is slightly on the right the returned point will be instead of you have to divide it by a factor of on my lumia  this can be seen in settings page  some apps don t work in background well  downloads may breaks when apps switched  currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that  this publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps localstorage folder  if you are careless during signup you are stuck and can t change the publisher id and therefore that naming of your packages  super fastest calling with home button shortcut  just press key on locked screen for seconds for phone call profile change etc run application  why can i not assign to run application for some button on locked screen  why can i not assign to run application for some screen region on locked screen  home automation is a huge market for windows devices  a big piece of this is being able to monitor control ip cameras such as the foscam hd cameras  right now we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done by using requestmessage transportinformation  but unfortunately this is application wide and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included  seems like there is a problem with a popup which seems to overlap the application bar  the strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered  i ve observed it on bot desktop and mobile uwp app  more description and sample code you can find here http stackoverflow com q  my app has no choice submit audit report feedback audit failure example an app that allows users to select a time i e tomorrow am to do something  user can also choose to run everyday every week etc  this feature is available on android i heard even on iphone  since the above code does not set a well known header the above code results in an exception misused header name  my company and thousands of others use sketch to develop app interfaces that we then give to our developers  there is currently no way how to display in webview https web page with invalid certificate even with user specific opt in  currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps easily know the revenue earned  more i earn more chances they will leave and start publishing their own apps  both apple and google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role who has no access to sales revenue reports  in windows mobile any third party app can act as a caller id app to intercept the call and set the phonecallorigin  but other apps cannot access phonecallorigin from phonecallhistoryentry  when developing coded ui test for a localized uwp apps test becomes dependent on texts that are localized  on most controls this can easily be handled by an automationid but on the corewindow and messagebox incl buttons you cannot set any automationid s so the coded ui test has the use the title to find the elements  i ve two apps with same name one is in phone and the other one is in desktop  now i created a universal app  tab version have a small number of users i need to upload new universal package to the phone version app  but the problem is the app name automatically reserved to the tab version and the package name also  i m not able to associate the application with the phone build in the store because the app name is not reserved to this there is no package name or package id for this in the store  how can i resolve this issue without changing the name of the phone build  see below the template of my button and the two different renderings  other strange differences did show up as well especially in grids but the example above is the craziest one  please tell me if you want some details about other mismatches  i ve developed application which targets windows phone  when xap is deployed on win mobile device it has some strange bug  after re installing the app uninstall deploy application s data stays the same it isn t removed after unstalling the app  but when i retarget the app to windows pone problem disappears  however when the barcode is generated it will generate this code as image  i can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode correctly  i can then enter the encoded image into the above mentioned decoder and it will decode more remote desktop services objects for windows store apps are no longer available for use as of windows and windows server technical preview  negative reviews are bad especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users  back in windows phone silverlight times i was able to get the content of the cameraroll much faster via the medialibrary second for the same amount of files  how can it be that this became so extremely slow with the uap  in silverlight it was once possible to register an app as an option for the edit picker in the photo hub https msdn microsoft com en us library windows apps jj v vs aspx  this is not possbile for uap apps  this option is already present in the desktop variant of the app but missing in the mobile app  the equivalent winrt api messagedialog provides no apparent means to copy the message to clipboard no response to right click no response to ctrl c  thanks for your attention  i ve got a win app in the store  i want to beta test a win version of it  so i set the app to hide stop selling i then submit the win version and get some promo codes watching my app analytics i see far more devices now have my win app than i intended because updates still get pushed regardless of the listing settings  if you are professional developer redesign your company loves this word the formal business invoice  when microsoft sends a money between the company for your business partner for example outsourced call center do you use credit card for such payment  it could be something like  for input nodes it would be very very appreciated  i have made an app when i search for it apps pops up and my app isn t any of them  i just chatted to support they told me that it was because the name was too generic '"
