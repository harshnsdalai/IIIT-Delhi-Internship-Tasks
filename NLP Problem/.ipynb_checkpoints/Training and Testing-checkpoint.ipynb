 this would extend the power already available with share pickers   perform more generic tasks and would result     better experience for the user   all this while keeping the sandbox mentality that

third party apps from competing with the built   apps   just looking   the list   reserved file types seems like all file types known   man are reserved   and then   remind myself that this   just   the   card   but then what   the point   the   card   the developer   restricted   the phone   internal memory     cannot read more   there   ssl tls socket support   windows phone   however currently

provide   good background service   running   background service just for seconds every minutes   restricting app developers from creating required apps for clients     client     well known home appliances manufacturing company and they insist   regular update from app even when app   not running which   successfully implemented   android and ios   but because   the restriction   windows phone development over background service client     the verge   dropping windows phone app for their product     what   suggest   give flexible background service for development and notify user while installing the app about the background services that will   running and battery consumption   might cause and then user can decide   install the app   not   but because   the restriction   windows phone development over background service client     the verge   dropping windows phone app for more   few days before updating the latest windows app studio   can still install into   phone

possible use case   smart watch that uses the phone     way   access information   the internet   for the most time the watch   disconnected from the phone but from time   time   could connect

watch and the phone and some cloud service may   involved the actual trigger from device   phone could   done with bluetooth     listening for incomming spp connections   too much     drain   long

all other steps are working really smooth but the pending certification   taking     days without showing any progress     there   way   add   progress       pending certification done   the account   that would   very nice for all the developers out there waiting for their app   become reality     the moment there are only apis for reading and writing nfc tags   unfortunately this   only   very small part   the nfc capabilities   with   iso smartcard support you would   able   communicate with smartcards like being used   public transport   supporting payment via nfc credit cards   these capabilities are well supported   other platforms and   would like   see this support     too   have you ever decided not   download   app while browsing the store simply because   did not have any ratings   reviews       then this issue should concern you     developer   the app store currently only shows consumers app ratings and reviews   the country that you live       for example     app   published   canada and the united states and only the users   canada leave   rating reviews then the users   the united states will not see those ratings and could potentially decide not   download the app   this also gives the false impression that your app   not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying   not enjoying the app         suggesting that microsoft implement   system   show   consumer all the ratings and reviews     understand there may   some issues with language etc   and   easy way   implement       this asides from bing translating wonderful app name user reviews worldwide reviews   your market this way   user can toggle between the world and local reviews   ratings and reviews are   important part     app store otherwise why would microsoft bother having them   ratings and reviews are   important part     developers promotion arsenal after all who would you rather believe the seller   ads   user reviews   the app   not all     are the instagrams   the world and depend   each and every ratings   can get       you think     only fair that users see all the reviews   the app store then please support this request   voting for     this also gives the more   the idea     install partially   all the data   the application   cloud services and not   the local device   currently there are   reports   show the purchases   downloads

winphone features and one   the which had took   attention   the notification area     think you need   make   different notification area     the winpho video   works like android and ios   you pull from the top   down and the notification area appears   why don   you use the winpho style   for example   show the notification area you swipe from left   right   when   notification appears you have options swipe   from the left   right and brings the notifications area   swipe the notification from bottom       ignore     press     open the application related   the notification   this notification     opinion will make winpho stills   different   from android and ios     hope   contribute     new vanguardist and different operational system     smartphone     hope you like     thank you and best regards   when   notification appears you have options swipe   from the left   right and brings the notifications area   swipe the notification from bottom   more   facebook for winpho needs better integration with facebook     would   extremely helpful   the emulator could use webcams   camera emulation   otherwise   scenarios are hard   develop without   range   devices     has become even more needed with the addition   wxga and the different scalings       improve microsoft account login usability   app   choose   login automatically with your microsoft account saved into phone also win   without insert login and password again         boring that you need   that also for microsoft apps like photosynth and skype     just want   tell you that   will   good   you give option   lock the applications specifically like sms       creating   popular app     bit     chicken and egg problem     would   great   see this circumvented somehow   one possibility instead   having   top charts style listing where the most popular apps are displayed   every phone anywhere create   new form   distribution where the results are randomized every time   user looks   the marketplace   now that obviously has the result   bad apps being near the top   lot   you modify that with ratings   highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less frequently and the rating   the app dwindles   for example   app   currently fairly well reviewed stars   however   never gets good visibility because   isn   the best which   actually subject     very wide variety   opinions     seems     that all good apps games should have   chance   decent exposure   the top charts and waiting     featured just isn   worth     another option       this with the featured apps   the marketplace   instead   ten featured games per day which all users see   would   better for each user   see   random set   games each time the marketplace   viewed     this way every decent game would get   considerable amount   exposure each day while apps that had   rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps   there are   lot   reasons why this might   difficult but   feel that with   little bit   thought this could     very profitable idea both for developers and for microsoft     two cents   highly rated apps should appear near the top more and they should appear less and less more   import alert tones   need   api   hide cprog exe and bring other application   front ground   please implement style triggers for windows phone

existing api         have   app that shows   filtered subset     user   contacts   should have   way   click   that user and show the user   details   the native experience       familiar with the suggestion   take the contact   details and   create them   your own   which would   great   the api exposed all   the user   details like the anniversary which   does not   also having   showcontacttask would allow     give   user   quick shortcut   post   message   twitter   facebook without having   implement those sdks especially since the apis   not currently give you access   social networking contacts     able   pull their social network handles   also having   showcontacttask would allow     give   user   quick shortcut   post   message   twitter   facebook without

whole process again but received the message that the alias was already   use   thinking this meant that   app name was already being used   someone else   changed the name slightly   this submission went through smoothly     later found that the original submission had also been successful even though   had hung   that there were now two duplicate submissions   processing certification with slightly different aliases     wanted   delete the extra one but but could not     could only change     manually publish and hope   delete   later     would   much preferable   remove   from the

for apps where multiple downloads may   running   once and the user wants   optimise the order   which they download   the majority   apps   see   the marketplace doesn   have any review       think that has   overall negative effect user wise community wise and dev wise maybe you should think about some way   reward those users who take their time   actually try   app and review       know that thinking   such   system isn   easy   you would have   think carefully about abuses   there   currently   indication that   application   being featured   would   nice   receive   email prior

the top thing that said people was   smaller text   take   much space   the app   make     the tiles can   see through and the background can     background image that would look nice   better

have   implement   contactpicker   make the user choose   implement the live sdk and force them   log   when the phone already knows     understand the reasoning for not allowing the user   have access   the mailboxes   the phone but there should     api   enumerate through accounts and get their statistics like the number   unread emails number   important emails and the total   mail count   there are more and more external sensors not only medical but all kind   proximity stuff for watches smart apliances cars and innumerable industrial applications that would pen the door   thousands

the textbox   however   you entered shorter lines you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time   the   cursor makes contact with some text   you will see   visually lock     the text when this happens     believe this will confuse users and create unecessary friction for consumers   make use   apps that depend   multiline input that potentially   longer than displayed

may have worked   the app and are now splitting   some people may sell their apps   others     all these cases   breaks the update cycle for existing users because the new owner would have   create

help     this   that   can upload another new game   the store itself       using visuall studio   updating   app listing that supports multiple languages   one   the most painful experiences when developing for windows   why can   not just have   store manifest that includes all localized descriptions screenshots etc   which will   detected when   upload the app via the dashboard     would allow     skip all that crazy input   different languages just   for example swap out one screenshot   alternatively provide   api for the submission process     can   least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves     would     great way   better integrate applications   there was   sports news hub     imagine the default setup could simply default   news and sports from msn   one     other affiliates then allow rss feeds     added   enhance that further   allowing   party application tie ins like espn   app   news from   bbc   cnn application     could even add features like they have

  please allow     maintain all app packages store assets descriptions screenshots and metadata     git repository and simply push     git remote   upload   currently     very tedious and takes hours   submit   app update especially when you have multiple app packages and lots   languages   you have   manually use the website   change descriptions switch languages lots   copy and paste remove each screenshot put   new screenshot     literally takes hours and   drives you crazy   instead   could get everything ready locally and     push and upload   all quickly   currently apps are executed   sandboxes and there     way   apps can work together   one app   look   information   the internet opens   another app that can scan barcodes   the same   true for applications and the   itself   some

that rotates   image   app that uploads images into the web and   app that   capable   send more     dont want use uac     security risk   but   want have metro apps   application developers currently pre mango have   facilities   access the   contents     incoming sms message     would   great   applications could register for such   capability thus enabling scenarios such   sms challenge authentication   add ability   set referrer and other custom headers when using httpwebrequest     company likes   but the nonexistence   visual voice mail   stopping   switch from the iphone     there   way   access voice mail metadata   distribute more application bar icons   sdk   least each one used   built   applications provide forum marketplace for other artwork including control templates styles   increase webbrowser control function   google has playbooks and apple has ibooks for better reading   ebooks and there are many third party applications which make easy reading

socket apis and duplex wcf communication   currently     not possoble   make connections behind proxy servers that require authentication   this very much limits business type apps that can use

images graphics pricing and keywords etc once the app   published without resubmitting   this would make bug fixes   spelling and screeshots simple would save microsoft from having   test submissions for metadata only   maybe sending   zip   system supported application error reporting service that would report back   developers application crashes and details     wish   could simulate multitouch   the emulator   pinch and zoom with mice   just like the picture extras       great   apps like twitter and facebook could register       the list   applications that   user can share   piece   text with   addition   email and sms   this enables   number   cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how   wants   share that info   this enables caching   and usage   offline maps   until windows phone this part was too painful and took   lot   time and work   hope there are some automated tool for taking localised screenshots   then   navigate   another page press the button and   take   screenshots again one for each language     the upload website   way   remove all screenshots and   way   upload all assets for all languages   once   provide   pre certification tool that runs all the tests the marketplace certification tool runs     developpers can have more confidence   will pass the tests and fix the issues before submitting   the marketplace   time saver for developers and microsoft   the phone currently plays   large selection   media formats         etc that aren   supported   the emulator   this makes apps that use these formats extremely hard   debug   would   awesome   you could fix this   just like the picture music extras     able   integrate     persons phone numbers unkown caller     add phone services   easy search for numbers       able   start   contact message app from the contact card   allow applications   register messaging endpoints   device       register     launcher chooser   ease   device inter application communication   when   see the palm pre   multitask switch   know there   something   can   better   hopefully with fluently switch and creative gesture and     now   can just use pivot and panorama but   can not handle their sensitive degree sometimes   feel       high and   want   edit   but   way     this   currently only store apps can   submitted   the store   please allow     submit existing windows desktop software   the store   with all the new screen sizes and resolutions testing   the emulator   certainly one way   try them out but     aid   even more rapid development     able   see them

possible   upgrade the app   project and still have     output support older versions   the     windows projects when updated   windows projects lose their ability   support windows   being able   target multiple versions   windows with   single project one that preferably built   single app package would   useful   furthermore upgrading that project   target the latest version   windows shouldn   cause support for the previous version   the       lost   ios developers get this feature   should windows developers   when the app gets built   generates   single package that can   more

remove their entries from the dashboard main app list graphs etc you can eventually add   page where all the apps iaps hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them   the

annoying     windows phone     had   nice photo auto upload capability that allowed   app creator   tie into the camera and automatically upload each pic that the user took   this was great because

uwp that   completely gone you can use   win   silverlight app       but that   not uwp   all   need   bring this functionality over   uwp especially since the onedrive space was disastrously cut   october and now users will want   different free service     which   upload pics   there are workarounds   course like creating   timed background app that wakes   and looks   the camera roll for new stuff every   often but that     polling approach which   always much less desirable and power efficient than   event driven one   thanks     windows phone       had   nice photo auto upload

appreciated   integrate facebook twitter youtube and other social accounts into feedly     can read the timeline posts and other   feedly   like your facebook news feed could     feed   feedly   new

 have their feeds pulled into feedly     would   great   there was   feedly plug   for the mozilla thunderbird email client   right now   can have several google apps open   separate tabs   thunderbird     each morning   start   day with   inbox google calendar and google reader each   their own tab right there together   one app     love that   with the fazing out   google reader

top right   out   place         minor thing but for someone who follows   lot   tumblr blogs   can get annoying     know you can set   preference   save   article     read later service instead   saving     feedly but   like feedly   save feature within the apps   however sometimes     prefer   send   article   instapaper readability   pocket and still have   saved   feedly   could you install something like that under the sharing options   have the app available   the for lion osx   the app store   http www spritzinc com about reading becomes more efficient because spritzing increases the time your brain spends processing content without having   waste time searching for the next word   the direct posting from the feedly   the yammer   much preferred   many   enterprise business persons   currently   can only choose safari and chrome   options     would   nice   open articles   the browser   actually use like mercury     case   many     use beyondpod   the     app for pod casts     was easy   integrate with google reader   perhaps   similar situation could   made with feedly     subscribe     youtube subscriptions   feedly and   much appreciate this feature     find   easier   keep   with   subscriptions   feedly than   youtube   however most   the time   just want   get some   those videos added     youtube playlist watch later     would   awesome   have   click option   add any youtube video   any post directly     youtube watch later playlist       not sure what the deal   with buffer but   seems like   needless step   for some unknown reason   decided   buffer   post until   tomorrow   what the heck     there   actual reason you cannot share directly   facebook twitter anymore       not allowed     you not have the proper agreements   place   can you get them   that would   wonderful       not the first person   post this   look         dislike the fact that you have started   mask users bitly urls with your own feedly links     realize that your link still pings   link and get the analytics but   have   custom url for   reason     understand why you might   this for the free version   feedly but   implore you   not mask users custom urls   your upcoming paid pro version   would love   click add   instapaper rather than opening   new window yes   have   password and even the browser javascript bug   thank you   add feedreader   the app center list   right now     connected   the wrong account   have more than one buffer accounts   there     option   disconnect   any way     already tried   reinstall the app   share directly with twitter instead   buffer       using this app for   ipad and yours for the iphone and laptop     would   great   you could share the api with the developer allowing   seamless sync amongst the apps     happens now with google reader   http mrreaderblog curioustimes   post supported google reader alternatives part two   deploy the latest version   feedly   that   can update the app     kindle fire     seemed like for   few days feedly was using chrome custom tabs instead   opening links   the external chrome app     was   little jarring   first but once   realized what was going     really liked     why did you quickly remove that feature     why did you quickly remove that feature     understand that   lot   people who choose   have links open   chrome may not like   but   really liked having links   added     chrome history while still feeling like   was   the feedly app   will you   making that   additional option along side open directly   browser   http getpocket com developer docs authentication   allow for default settings   that when this new defaulting mode   enabled clicking the evernote icon will save with   additional interaction   default tags would also   helpful even better configurable content keyword tagging would   great   have   option   make items open directly   the chrome browser   mobile   please make   feedly widget gadget for igoogle   equivalent     chrome firefox extension that shows   counter   unread items with   dropdown that lets the user see the items   similar   the official reader notifier from google   there can   apps installed   system that catch http url and display its content inside itselves   built   browser   feedly brakes such behavior   pushbullet     amazing sharing app     pushes stuff from your one device   other   well     other person   sometimes when     reading   feed and   want   share   directly with   person     very easy     push     someone     know   already does that for android app well because android   lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when   hit share icon   the feedly app but   would   awesome   have     the web app   basically instead   having   manually install the firefox plugin every time there     update   should auto update   maybe you should consider including the plugin   the firefox addon repo marketplace   would   great     able   read   feedly feeds   ighome com instead   having       feedly com     flipbook sort   did this but they did   awful and   unistalled   yes   want feedly   replicate google reader but   want       more   can you bring     twitter feed and know which one       already read         that google reader feedly does for rss but with twitter   facebook   pinterest   give   one place   consume everything but only see   once unless   save     ohhh that would   awesome   feedly client doesn   support android     was forced   use alternative android apps     tried more than     nook simple touch   and all   them have the same problem when trying   log into feedly   after entering google username and password   get onto the moved temporarily page   after clicking   the only link   the page   get   empty page   offering other ways   log     even feedly   own registration system might also help   every time   restart chrome feedly mini appears   every web page     want   turn   off       updated   preferences which works until   close the browser and restart   then   preference   set   show   again     have tried the greader and press android clients   both show     google login     web view within their apps   this   insecure because   cannot verify that     not phished and that     talking directly   google   such   login process should not   allowed   login should   through the google account stored   the android device   make the safari extension open the feedly page     new tab window when clicking the feedly button similar   the safari greader extension     didn   see anyone else suggest this but   would think   would   very simple for flip board   add support for your service     see   reason why they wouldn   because   know they transferred over   bunch   google reader feeds but they aren   doing what feedly     would   nice   have   would love the ability   monitor specific pages that don   have rss feeds   set intervals and   able   vary the alert options such   getting   email etc when the pages change   thanks and please keep   the great work   can   only not find         really gone   since today   cannot send   instapaper anymore which was very useful for         using safari       blogs are music blogs and     say   posts have soundcloud streams embedded into them     visit the sites externally for every page   not very convient   could   make this happen   google reader never did but   suspect that   because they quit investing     into improvements   allow     import twitter lists and view them like regular feeds   support login with twitter facebook microsoft yahoo   account etc and remove google account login support   allow android app   provide   option   open within the application   open     browser     have read that you did have tumblr integration and then   was gone   like   send   tumblr button and liking posts from tumblr feeds     assume there was problems with   but some     really use   and   would   great   have   back     far this   the best feed reader     tried   please consider     thanks     android devices     hard   add new feeds   feedly   you can   use paste   the search bar field and you can   use feedly     sharing option   other android apps dolphin browser etc       really annoying   remember every interesting site until   can use   desktop computer   please please add   option   easily add content   using   mobile device   thanks   make   chrome packaged app for feedly please       can launch feedly from google desktop app launcher       talking about just integrating   stream followed tumblrs that   reading not posting     keep reading that feedly has tumblr integration but can   find   anywhere     just want   tumblr content   show     articles without having   add every single one   rss     keep reading that that   possible but can   find any setting   even anyone explaining how     done         indeed possible maybe   short how     the help section     order       isn   that would also   great   have clarified somewhere faq maybe   youtube video work fine   feedly but somehow vimeo video   not showing the content instead showing error #   take   the verge for example   better support for podcasts     use beyondpod     android phone and   supported integration   sorts with feedly     desire       able   catch     podcasts either     phone       desktop such that       listened     podcast completely from either source     from   browser   home   work       cell phone that the episode would   marked listened     read and disappear from the list   feedly   any     machines   well   drop off     beyondpod list   ideally   feedly and beyondpod could get together and synchronize the position within   podcast would   excellent   that said     podcast player feedly leaves   lot     desired   from what   can tell merely starting   play   podcast marks     read   essentially completely listened     furthermore       careless and click somewhere else like   read another article feedly will stop the playback and     the place   clicked     should warn     finally   popout player would   nice for the audio video   podcasts   chrome extension required too much permission extension can access your data   all websites   please reduce required permission for chrome extension   work with soundgecko   anything   mark   feedly goes   soundgecko for readout   feedly should let users login through mozilla persona   gravatar which don   track users   persona   made   the makers   the firefox browser and gravatar   made   wordpress     would like   change   log   for feedly   that   does not match   google account which contains other personal data   how     cba   leave feedly but   want   know what other people are saying and   want     able   contribute without signing     anything       blog does use disqus the comments should   viewable and   reply able     added directly from feedly   make app extension plugin for all browsers with one click   add feed from any website   there are some private blogs   wordpress com   you can subscribe   them   wordpress reader once you have access   them but you can   use them outside wordpress   when you could connect your feedly   your wordpress com account why shouldn   you   able   subscribe   them     don   know   wordpress has   api for this     guess such   feature would     big advantage for your service   even though     logged     google   the same browser and     already logged     feedly with   google account and granted access   use what   wants   still keeps logging   out then making     through this process every couple   days why     wish   feedly pro user     save the feeds   evernote   want   tag the note not only the notebook but also the tag   evernote   the utm parameter added   your links breaks them   some sites   case   point new york magazine   creating   win win situation for readers and content creators   further thoughts feedly could develop subscription options for content creators       feedly handles payment and delivery   information creator creates information and receives revenue   readers get access   contribution only content       been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want     and that benefit them and others     would like   see better integration with google services across the board specifically gmail google and google drive     would like the ability   email articles with gmail post them   google and save them   google drive cause google doesn   own quite enough     soul yet   though this idea has been expressed   varying degrees with regard   specific services like google translate     not seen   expressed generally   this option existed before   now   have     the the source article   have the option   post     linkedin group         relatively minor detail but   would   really convenient   import rss from other readers   beyond pod     main feed reader when     not     computer     like   because   its built   browser and various settings for feeds and podcasts which the google reader app didn   have   please consider speaking   the people   beyond pod   integrate with their app   feedly   beautiful and   would love   use       windows phone   allow publishers   trigger feedly   refresh feedly   cached version   their rss feeds   feedly doesn   seem   notice when existing feed content for   date time changes and refresh their cache   letting publishers trigger that refresh could     work around when there are errors   the publisher   feed   add integration with trello   evernote sharing   feedly seems   cause the chrome evernote plugin   sign out the user and then feedly takes you     web page version   evernote rather than using the evernote plugin clipper   push   directly into the application   push   transparently   the web     just see   blank screen       since       work computer   can   control the software upgrade     you don   fix that   will seriously consider droping feedly   chromecast support would   great     could read   news   big screen     love how you have pintrest integration   your images please consider adding gimmebar integration   well   the type   users   gimmebar   pintrest   night and day   great app   gimme bar https gimmebar com     above       love     able   export all     saved for later articles     kindle     can read   via   ink     used   subscribe   instapaper   premium service and   exported all     articles into   kindle book with   table   contents etc     feel like this might   easy   integrate with   service that   already   and running like sendtoreader com     would gladly pay   have the option for feedly             own and send     kindle   feedly allows folder order     rearranged instead   appearing   alphabetical order   this   useful           prefer that   group   groups   feeds   some folders appear   the bottom   the all items view     changed the folder order via the feedly web interface organize but the changes   folder order are not being reflected     reader     logged out   then back into the feedly account     reader but the folders are still appearing   ascending alphabetical order   please enhance your api     rarely use google plus but there are few very interesting people using   who   post     like   read   for example linus torvalds     feedly android app when   share something through email   goes straight   gmail app when   rather want   use the regular email app   that plataform   make   possible for     choose the mail app   want   use       feedly users   all know the pain   having   deal with truncated feeds   this problem becomes more prevalent when using mobile apps that rely   feedly like press   android     would like   request the capability   run articles through the readability mobilizer before they   inserted into our feeds   this would help   solve the problem   truncation and poor article formatting     have missed the email subscriptions feature   the old pre bloglines ever since they discontinued       would gladly become   feedly pro subscriber   you offered something comparable       nutshell you could create   bunch   random email addresses that you could use when subscribing   newsletters etc and then any emails sent   one   those addresses would show       standard html feed   this was fantastic for those sites which offer more content   their email newsletter than their rss feed   lack   rss feed completely     perfect use case for this would     turn twitter facebook etc notifications   and forward those   these email addresses instead   having them clog     inbox   this could   used for any   these closed services which   not offer rss feeds   the closest solution   this   have found     use mailinator   create the throwaway emails and they support rss feeds but they also strip out all images attachments etc and generate plain text feeds   this isn     good solution   please consider adding this type   feature   feedly     igoogle there was the google reader gadget   one   the very popular alternatives   igoogle   netvibes com     would   cool   there was   feedly gadget for netvibes   oembed     format for allowing   embedded representation     url   third party sites   eagerly waiting   connection with evernote   there are   tags   use daily   the way flipboard has implemented twitter   that   grabs the content   the tweet and displays     rather than   user having   click   link   read   article   view   image   simply gets the article content   image and displays   with any text   the tweet acting     caption     would   great     could integrate   twitter account into feedly the same way and have full images   articles displayed alongside   rss images and articles   soundgecko     great way     able   listen   articles that you want   read later while   the car     the       use   every day     would love   have direct integration   that   can easily send articles   soundgecko from within the feedly app       only noticed this   two feeds   own blog and xkcd       both cases what should     float left   actually changed   the code     float right   see attached   this does not occur   google reader where the original layout displays normally   since the attribute isn   changed   reader   concluded that the problem   with feedly not the rss feed itself   please enhance the new back   function http blog feedly com dropbox vault and enable local drive integration   this would allow anyone   back     dropbox googledrive synology cloudstation microsoft onedrive   any other cloud solution which has   local drive representation   addition   allowing     save       local machine     can login into   account for the past days     was logging   using   google credentials   the oauth screen   popping   and hanging     would   nice     able   add usenet newsgroup   add content such   comp   mailing list would   great   well great job   something like antennapod https play google com store apps details     danoeh antennapod would   very nice   maybe you could send them   api   something   they can add the option   sync with feedly once greader disappears     would   super useful   you are able   choose your own default email app   not everybody uses the gmail app   default some others use cloudmagic mailbox inbox   and such   please guys make   happen     cannot login     feedly account using windows microsoft edge even after deleting all cookies etc     can still login with iexplore     cannot tell   this     problem with edge   with feedly   google reader allows you   get   public rss feed for each category label used     very useful for sharing feeds using   with wordpress blogrolls ecc     would   great   google button opened   app   ios       installed     used google reader   get the best posts from many blogs and share them through   own blog hosted   blogger   google reader had the option send   blogger   that   the only feature     missing   feedly     can add   tumblr blogs     groups   read them but     want   like them   have   open the page   another browser window     would   nice     could get the tumblr heart right   the feedly page like how   can save for later   reblog support would   nice too but mostly just like   least     know   many folks including yours truly who use feedly   conjunction with pocket     noticed that buffer and evernote each have   keyboard shortcut   the web interface     feature request   rather straightforward add   similar shortcut for save   pocket   for example   you want   have   feed with   particular tracked tag from tumblr feedly could create   feed   for example   you want   feed for every tumblr feed containing the hashtags #retail #design http www tumblr com tagged retail design would     feedly feed   the current version   your chrome web app does not behave correctly when you click the icon     chrome web app this should bring   existing open window   tab   the front     case     window minimize   into the chrome launcher   maximize   from there feedly   web app however keeps   opening   new window   tab everytime you click       the current version   your chrome web app does not behave correctly   when you click the icon     chrome web app this should bring   existing open window   tab   the front     case     window minimize   into the chrome launcher   maximize   from there   that can really drive you nuts   there   almost   other web app that does this google being the stupid other exception   the rule   please fix this   updating the manifest json file inside the app     should   enough   make the urls match the actual url   the open app       case you switch   https   use that   the manifest too   currently   there     link     app   the google play store   opens   the feedly browser instead   using the play app which   frustrating   this   just one example   many     seems       problem with opening   the browser only     should have the choice   for instance feedpress can   see how many people subscribe   feeds through feedly   please allow some way for rss services   get access   that data especially since feedly     big   right now       black box   fix     you can   how about giving feedly compatibility with   this then that   posting   pocket via the chrome extension   currently very laborious opens     separate tab then loads all your pocket stories every time   pending more straightforward integration with pocket how about allowing     send our entire saved list straight   pocket   you reader   nearly unusable with tools that allow mouseless browsing vimperator pentadactyl please replace all links you emulated with divs   menu   the left with real hrefs   these are found   such tools   let the content creators see that their content   viewed   your service like http feedburner google com     add rss source   click the rss icon   the url bar   chrome but with feedly   can         please make   way     that   rendering   messed       and       super grateful that you guys got   working   all   july   but this   something that will need     fixed   when showing news   just title lines   chrome     show title per line     say and the   line   the article   revealed after the title   upon clicking           every news line   effectively lines line for the title then the   line   the article starts and goes   for   full   line   this looks really weird and   quite distracting when trying   read   rss   again super grateful you guys got   working somewhere other than chrome   life saver since   can only use       windows   tablet but this needs     fixed eventually   when saving   pocket   this case   third party app having visual feedback that the save   happening would   useful     have performed   save multiple times   its not always instant   limitation   integrating with   third party   understand   maybe the press   save could change the item color until saved and the save icon could   disabled until     saved   now that   have   wonderfully awesome evernote integration     time   make   easier   use     have quite   few notebooks and would like     able   select one notebook     default     can simply click the evernote icon and voila the article saved     default notebook   when   send content from feedly web   evernote the formatting comes across wonky and unclear   when   send   from other similar tools like   reader   comes across     article and without the extra content from the website     wish   add content   evernote with the clearest formatting   can     needs     better than feedly currently supports   many people want you   get rid   the need for   extension and make feedly   pure web based app             you   not going   please explain why not   what   really want are gmail style filters for feeds   automatically star   mark   read based   matches     typical example   article subject contains this week   mark     read     article body contains   name star   and send   instapaper     think ifttt integration could get   there with not too much   the way   additions add trigger with pattern   keyword matching   subject sender body etc add mark   read     action     should   possible   specify actions   ifttt that mark articles   read when triggered     would like     some action when new articles show   some categories but   don   want   see them anymore   feedly after this action   executed   lots   blogs contains latex code   display mathematical characters   this should display   the characters themselves rather than just   the code   alpha should   the greek letter alpha and   one   this would make   much easier   read philosophical and mathematical blogs   pages created with wordpress allow this   this would allow you   minimize the rights required for users interested only   the reader   keyword filtering deleting articles authors not   interest prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed   ifttt   some tumblrs   read have passwords   them         great   have   way   add these feeds   feedly   allowing     enter the password once from feedly   make   possible for     open articles and links inside articles   safari from within feedly       looking for something like this but for feedly https chrome google com webstore detail checker plus for google   lbmpmiibbncadgagnfcloaeilfhomemb   create delicious integration   allow sharing   delicious com   the side area allows you   include your facebook and twitter feed     you   using feedly   your homepage   quick overview   upcoming events might   nice   please let   sign   with     and password   chose not   google account       like   connect articles with items     calendar         read   article about concert and add   item   calendar attaching link   article       read   article about grant   scholarship and create calendar item for documents submission deadline attaching link   article       limited       windows     work   all   get   the same white screen all the   and   users are complaining about     there anything you can     make feedly work         few day ago   have started using you excelent app but one thing annoying       favorite web page which   http lodz naszemiasto   rss artykuly xml   not acceptable   your app   could you fix     hello feedly developers here     proposal   how   create   win win situation for readers and content creators   flattr   still not lifting mainly due     lack off content creators willing   register themselves   flatter   also flatters prototypish content search function makes   hard for users   find proper content   feedly has   user friendly interface with   pretty reliable search function and share options   several other applications     might     idea   add   flatter function   feedly   alternatively   simple flattr inspired donate function might       feedly pro readers sign   for the donate option where they can donate   amount   money for articles they liked   the amount   the donation       the user the user pays   advance into his pro account and may spend that money for article donations       feedback   graphical representation   number and amount   donations and how many readers have read and   donated   certain article   shown     this way the current intransparent recommendation count would become more transparent   all articles can   donated too   the donated money will   transferred   all publishers who are interested   getting donations similar   unclaimed flatters   bloggers authors who want   claim their money   this   registering their rss feed and bank   paypal account   feedly   after registration unclaimed donations will   transferred from donator   author   feedly keeps   certain percentage   the donation     administration fee   benefits gives readers   easy way   support the authors and content they like   gives content creators   additional revenue model   gives feedly   additional revenue model   opens   further possibilities around subscription paid only content contributors influencing content creators etc   feedly could   invent the way   consume articles   the same way how amazons kindle unlimited did with the book market     easy   use donate function might turn feedly pro into   universal news portal for fact based quality news   this function might change the independent news market     similar way   amazons kindle unlimited did   the book market and might attract both readers and authors   sign   for   feedly account   anyway the most important feature     find the simplest way   transfer money from article readers   article authors   feedly could   the perfect platform for that     have two twitter accounts that   use regularly one for work and   personal account     often post   both from feedly but this requires   lot   logging   and out   integration with tweetdeck would allow     easily post   either account     often want   read articles     later time   safari   readling list   would love   have   direct link     this     you think     possible   mod this little software google reader notifier   yonizaf http code google com   google reader notifier windows   notify   when new feedly feeds are available   currently   browser and mobile version one has often     two step navigation       original content     youtube rss for uploads   browser and mobile version   embeddes video which   not what some     want     prefer   see original content most   the time   along with mark   read save links there could   url link which will drive   the original site   applies   browser and mobile versions     would   awesome   play all videos one   one like     playlist but without   hassle   creating one     often have many short videos which   have   click individually which   pretty annoying when   want     sth else and not touch computer   feedly     website   luakit     browser     should   able   use feedly   luakit     understand that offline support   being worked   and can   wait   use that functionality however since google reader   shutting down within weeks and byline reader   the only offline reader currently available for commuters   would   fantastic   you could work together   unfortunately they only pull their feeds from google reader   the android app   missing   mark   unread option     would   great   you could add   link bookmark right into your diigo account while reading   feedly         blogger and   want   make   easy for people   subscribe   having   flare unit for them   add   feed   their feedly but   simply cannot find   working flare unit   add     feedburner   and   seem     having trouble making one     own   please create and host   flare unit and provide the url for bloggers   easily add this option for their readers who use feedly   sina weibo     service like twitter   china   has biggest market share     can use flipboard   access   feeds   sina weibo but   like feedly better       can   done   feedly   will   great for     now   shows recent items which makes   unusable     cannot see more and have         website anyway   the integration   not useful   all   the button   subscribe   rss with feedly   firefox actually does nothing   some articles include slideshows with article information that have     viewed with   swipe action   because feedly   swipe action moves   the next feed its not possible   view the slideshow   either allowing   function         webpage   your internet browser outside   feedly   using another action   view the slideshow   other similar apps have this functionality   would   quite useful     workflow   least   since you can integrate with twitter   would   nice   have   saved links across both platforms show       nice readable format   feedly       like   have feedly automatically detect youtube videos   feeds and     save   post with   youtube embed automatically add that specific video     watch later feed   youtube   this way   can pull   the youtube app     phone   tablet later and watch these videos     chromecast   make the feedly reader browser extension more like the google reader extension   add   drop down menu   the sources with number   unread items   list the latest unread articles     scrollable manner and add   mark all   read button and the link   the feedly reader   maybe you could also add   link   the preferences and please make sure that clicking   link     article marks     read   feedly thanks   footnote popovers   used   many popular blogs and wikipedia display the footnote itself within   pop   bar   text bubble right next   the main article text   relates         properly formatted rss article the reading app will display the footnote inline and not require invoking the web browser and going online   can feedly   rss parser   made   not break this functionality please     want   open feeds outside   feedly sometimes and look   the site   came from     prefer   use chrome and   crashes constantly   feedly     ipad     browse beyond the article   page         more stable option that selecting chrome   the preferred browser   feedly   also   should have the choice     not going   leave feedly       great app   just looking for   option that let     list   articles from oldest   newest like   have     the   the site       looking for   consistent experience     currently use newsblur but     love   transfer all   feeds via opml   feedly   unfortunately feedly   opml support   artificially limited   google reader   exact opml format but there     reason   can   expand     handle newsblur   opml download format for importing into feedly   let   configure the directory and file names when saving   dropbox with tokens like year month date feed name post date etc   when you click     rss feed   firefox   shows you   preview   the current feed with   option   subscribe       but the current add   doesn   add   option   the list   programs   subscribe using       tried adding   manually but   doesn   work and   any case   shouldn     that awkward   also would   nice   petition firefox devs   have     standard   please remove unsaved items from dropbox   add   preference   would also mitigate this   allow all your saved for later items     exported     bookmark file     similar format   the firefox and google chrome bookmarks export tool   this will allow bulk importing   saved for later items into tools like pinboard       just cant use the chrome extrension     won   allow     log   the window containing the form   closed   soon   the form has finished loading     love feedly       really well programmed app   nevertheless there   one thing that annoys     when   press   link     article that     reading   feedly then the link will always open inside feedly   there     option   open the link directly   the browser safari       case chrome   sometimes     necessary   open links   the browser out   convenience and sometimes for usability   usually   end   opening the link   feedly wait for the site   load and then     into the options menu   open the site once more   chrome     would     much easier just   have   context menu item that gives the option   open   link directly   the browser   support for reading latest gmail mails directly from inbox feed just the same   igoogle   when   switch   ios   another application       translate   word and switch back again the reader goes     title page instead staying   the page   was reading which   not pleasant   possibly some translation functionality might   useful     can set the preferred browser   ios this rocks   however     then click   sharing and google plus   opens   safari     suggestion     honour the preferred browser   chosen when using more generic based web sharing services       not need all the pro features       love   pay year just for evernote integration though   this function   currently available   the gmail and pocket ios apps   which   button appears   the top left corner   the chrome browser which will allow the user   quickly return   feedly when they view   page   chrome from feedly   more convenient than using multitask function   integration   support   work with net news wire for mac and reeder and instapaper for ios   recently there was   change that forced you   use   buffer account   share   social networks such   facebook   seems kind   pointless for those who don   have   buffer account nor want one   have   create   account and have     the middleman between feedly and facebook     loved the way facebook sharing was   clean   the end   articles and available for comments before posting       ain   broke don   fix     feedly allowed mailing articles through gmail directly instead   bringing     mail client     want that feature back     would like   mail   articles directly   the   hack does not work for mailing lists   when   tag   article   feedly   want the tags   follow when   export the article   evernote with the built   evernote feature for feedly pro plan         now when   export with the evernote button   article   have   manually log     evernote and   the tag again     would   nice     were able   view content from twitter embeds such   images   feedly   some libsyn feeds don   link   the libsyn item but rather the audio file directly   you used     able   right click   the item   feedly and save     now you have   open the file and use save page     please fix this   beeline reader full disclosure     the founder has browser plugins that apply eye guiding color gradients   make reading faster and easier   over   people find that these gradients improve readability and the plugins work great   feedly   but the beeline functionality could   built into the feedly   using the beeline javascript library   add google   option for feed that appear   the left   the app and also   your main feed   when   long press     link   feedly       web view     given the option   add     reading list but not   instapaper   any   the other read later services   when you select   preferred   service   should also   available when you long press   link   that you can send that link directly   your favorite service rather than having   open the link wait for     load then send     instapaper   pocket   whatever you prefer     have searched high and low google duckduckgo feedly com which redirects       feeds from where there are   other links pimpmysafari dead link apple   safari extension gallery everywhere     see people talking about the extension all over the place but for the life       cannot locate   link   the damn thing   the abillity   export   article   post directly   kindle   and other   book readers     the firefox extension selecting oldest first under change layout doesn   stick     keeps resetting   unchecked   the sort   newest first the next time you enter that category   import google current feeds into feedly   add ability   share whole articles   evernote   this option   very important when rss feed contains only text excerpt   make feedly more sandboxed   android feedly chrome     have   chrome icon   the action bar     think its for open   browser   maybe share with chrome   anyway       great   this opened the currently visible article   the browser instead   the previous article   that   how   used   work and   think that makes more sense   sometimes after     clicked into   article into   chrome tab and then clicked the back button   end     the feedly app   top level rather than   the article summary       presented with the feedly app   splash screen along the way       one has   open each post one wants   read later   often   have little time and just want   scan headlines and make sure the ones that seem important get into the readitlater pile   unify login feedly allowing access   more than one source   facebook   google   microsoft     just depending   what the user decided accounts relate     would like the feedly chrome app   act just like the google reader one shows how many feeds   have and   can click   them individually   add the number   followers   your subscribe button like bloglovin already does     displayed   blogs   provide the html code with your other buttons   integrate twitter cards   article preview page   that when viewing   article that has   embedded twitter card with all its information   shows the card instead   plain text   when   save   article   evernote the resulting note   the text and images but not what the webpage looks like   the evernote web clipper allows     save the full page but   would love     able     this straight from feedly     currently use pocket     read later app but was hoping   move   evernote   right now   takes clicks and navigating   another tab for saving   pocket   would   nice       handled   the same window with pop     just with single click   also       possible   override save for later   pocket       like   have feedly integrate with bit     bit     bookmark function combined with     url shortener and usage information would   really useful when sharing from feedly   please allow chrome feedly and other browsers feedly   customize favourite saving tool   that   can save   pocket with one click and please also cut the settings   the pocket   end for adding   new item   would   most appreciated     currently use gread widget   see   unread count   google reader       how   get notified that there   unread items while       the mac

interface     would like   read   instapaper saved articles via feedly     use feedly and the buffer link     work environment     have googled and found   the moment feedly only works   one web browser which   google chrome     are limited   one browser which   internet explorer   our work environment     are currently unable   use your services   please can you give     fix   enable your program   work       other user   who are using your program for work purposes will have   similar problem     makes   difficult for   teams   support more than one browser       like     able   save articles   mindsky similar   other integrations     available with their save tool http sky mind         frustrating that   don   need   remember passwords anymore when     using safari but   need   exit feedly     settings safari passwords look for the site copy password     feedly again and paste password   apply the awesome mobile app feature   the web interface     would love     able   save

     web developer     not like plugins that add elements   the dom   each page   can you use   traditional address bar button   simple timeline were you can add content from twitter accounts facebook sites profiles     own categorie       working     feedly application and   want   add some pro features like   stream search but     not able   test these because   don   have   pro account       suggestion     offer developers   switch   turn   off pro features   the sandbox   obviously this should   somehow restricted   that this system can     abused   feedly always inserts quotation marks   posts   buffer   please remove the quotation marks   make buffer post template editable like already the twitter post template   the use case   that     surfing the web and   find   site that     like   follow     drag the url     feedly bookmark and feedly adds the feed     account even better would   the ability   categorize the feed     add     the ability   let indigo read the title   the posts perhaps with commands   marks   unread save even read the whole article like   interactive radio   you recently added function and allowed     save   article   evernote that   great   however evernote   service for china   not supported   please   not abandon market   china   please remove google requirement     would   great   chrome and opera weren   the only options for opening   articles         using your chrome app   due   the way your article popup   positioned its close button sits directly above the side pane   although   mouse click   properly sent   the close button any mouse movement after the popup goes away   sent   the side pane which causes     intelligently expand and reflow the list   articles that     trying   read       really annoying     really love how   can browse the latest articles from all feeds   the ios version but this doesn   seem       option   the chrome web app version     might just not   able   find the option     someone else has anything   add then please comment   keep the awesome work   guys     some point can   get google keep integration     along side pocket   that     they have   api for       have   jabber account googletalk     would like   receive the headlines   items arrive       client     soon     log   online your jabber bot could return   looking   defined   the settings   fresh news headlines         already connected the bot could write headlines with links     upon receipt   the news     rss subscription     facebook page   blocked   the plugin     uninstalled all plugins and   only reactivated the feedly plugin     sure       have   feed     folder named cooking   would like the ifttt ingredient entitled articlecategories   return cooking   currently   returns nothing   please make   app for blackberry playbook because there are   apps that support feedly   blackberry app world for playbook   this would make integration with other stuff   newsbeuter possible   this could make the feedly opml   canonical source   feeds for other apps that   user wants   use   reset the rss subscribe function after someone uninstalls your extension   the current uninstall leaves several settings   your about config and makes other changes which make   impossible   subscribe using live bookmarks anymore       had   switch back   feedly just     can subscribe   new feeds   for     actually provides   worse experience than the builtin browser   brings chrome   the foreground and opens the link   tapped     new tab     get back   feedly   have   back out     into recent apps   what   want       able   skim through   feed items and quickly open   tabs   the background then       browser and read through them     leisure   having tap always open   foreground tab   okay but probably better     configurable   however     article title view allow long press   bring     menu   open   new external browser tab     least allow configuring the action for long press     lot   the rss feeds   read force you       the full site   read the full article   lifehacker     good example   one thing that would   nice   the ability     able   hit one button   open all   the unread articles for   category   new browser tabs rather than having   click each one separately     would   nice   have   similar feature   mobile except the way   would work would     add all   the articles   pocket     alternative read   later app pocket all   something like that       want   subscribe   tumblr blog assume rss   the end     link   paste   now have   manually add rss   links like http spaceyspacelifeisneat tumblr com   subscribe   the good read tagline isn   attached     twitter posts when   schedule the posts through buffer   please add this feature   make   possible   link   article   your facebook business page   right now feedly isn   consistantly running across browser this needs     investigated and fixed     work which adivertisement     like   seeing new video ideas but when   try   see vevo video   the feedly   never can only youtube videos       constantly missing important content that happens   google     don   check   regularly   the unfortunate thing about this   that     had   rss feed     include     feedly but google does not offer this     would   great   there was   way   see all   the content     see   google via the api and present     feedly   being able   add   click feed for facebook https www facebook com help would also   quite useful     have noticed that     difficult   add new blogs that   want   follow including   own   when   search for emi ito illustration   the website www emiitoillustration com nothing comes     this   the case even when   have subscribed   the blog through feedly through the feedly button     blog   would   cool     could view the basecamp progress feed   feedly     use the saved items while   mobile   flag items for review         would   nice   have   indicator   the chrome extension icon   remind       have saved items   review     need huffduffer integration   send selected audiofiles from within   rss feeds   this service   worked perfectly   google reader   depends   connections and permits their are not just one profile related posts     requires   integration with google api perhaps even cooperate with google   make this specific data accessible     version   with   and later   windows and windows you can drag   web site url from the address bar   the taskbar and pin the site   your taskbar for easy access   this makes for quick access   the site   imo   also helps with the brand   the site   the app   front and center for the user and feels like any other application   web sites like tweetdeck pandora facebook bing etc all include this functionality   most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon   when viewing feeds from dribbble com   would like   have   like button that   integrated with the like mechanisms from their site   when browsing   site with rss and atom metadata header the chroma and firefox plugin presents   transparent button   quickly and easily allow you   add this feed   feedly   could the same   added   safari   having   pop   window open   pretty clunky   should just   able   click the icon and assuming the account link   active signed   send   readability     would   really helpfull   have   feature   that shortens articles like summly   wavii   furthermore     have     compatible with any rss feed   have     list   for that kind   feature compared with the already existing and wonderfull feedly   would love   pay because   makes   reading faster   recently the visit website launches the internal browser but   fails   load anything   you can launch safari from the internal button but then you have   bounce back and forth between apps   this works fine   the iphone but not   ipad         using url for recent uploads from   youtube account example https www youtube com playlist list uuispcad svnxgvivr syva   the page from the url loads fine and shows recent uploads but subscribing   that url   feedly   missing out some videos for example   can   see video europa universalis   common sense multiplayer   the feed     was uploaded yesterday thought feedly shows some videos before   and after   why that one   missing   not sure   that   youtube only related spotted   with     that   really bad though   might   missing some random content and noone would know about     please use feedly users rather than google   users     suggest   feedly   google calendar feature     saw     preview for   show next week and   want     reminded regarding this feed entry     will   great   you will develop   windows software for those who would like   read their feed   the computer       least make the browser extension useful firefox add   has   use     want   one stop shop for all   these aspects     internet life     would also mean that   dont have   try and search for the video channels   subscribed     youtube within feedly     just click subscribe and they appear     feedly   same for tumblr twitter and facebook   something similar   flipboard   functionality except your feed reader   immensely better than theirs       like   plug feedly into mac   rss screensaver but believe there     way           would like     able   thumbs     down videos from   youtube feeds from within feedly   also allow   youtube video   continue   play while   scroll through the rest     feeds   please add evernote support   the iphone for pro users   why was   necessary for   all   have   cloud version but   option   explanation   any time that all   feeds have gone   first   all   love feedly       like   suggest reverting the change that was made   last version regarding the safari browser

all     note and picture from web pages     would   great   have some integration with that app   feedly   fails   post   twitter from ios needs     fixed   the share icon can prevent   user   click   something behind even         small icon   and   play some times with javascript and     influence     script but   the extension bar   won   bother   script anymore   same for debugging webpage   and

advise   feedly   really bad   discovering feeds when given only the url   google reader used     able     this with pretty much every url you threw     and   doesn   seem     terribly complicated   giving this url   feedly returns   feeds   however   you manually google what the standard format for feeds   with wordpress and try out   which seems like something that feedly might have been able   guess   begin with     had   turn off the windows tray app   chrome would gradually get slower and slower   new development since feedly asked   run the always   tray app       sure     the app because exiting   cleared   all the browser response problems   either fix     make feedly work always   without browser interference   not much else   say include   icon for flipboard   integration

  even tracks this fact and prevents them from starting   new trial later   contract this with the windows phone world where   tell you   want trial mode but   have   track the number   days since install whether the user has purchased etc     the user uninstalls and installs again later   have   idea   for   app that doesn   require   login   there     account   tie the usage   and doesn

while browsing most   the websites that use vendor specific prefixes and non standard code   antutu results show and score only   graphics and the whole system       all   gets rendered really well and almost lag free   apart from these   game like asphalt has almost the same lag   minion rush does while those two are quite much different   from these   concluded that   big part     rendering

pornographic and sexually explicit needs     well defined   furthermore age ratings   dev center dashboard can   set per app according   the content   the app     the app fills out this information there   should not   taken down unless   has pornographic   sexually explicit material which   not well defined   store policies   would     too much   ask for   api that wraps whatever mechanism   required   accomplish this     container for starting applications inside     windows iot core instead   full screen   providing separate   and   factors would enable       used   objects without fixed aspect ratios   with separate   and   scale measurements both objects could   resized via pinch stretch   you can use wireshark   inspect packets and see that queries having   class   any will   answered     dns   registration from bonjour but will not   answered   the above dns   registration   create   api that takes     argument   command     string   and using that string the api may activate the command like cortana does when you say hey cortana   command but without voice interaction     would     huge advantage   support this attribute also   the app object   the app xaml file and   make this the ultimate root   allow license assignment for   application     tied   azure   group similar   how licenses   office can   managed     want   create windows service which runs

preview available for offline downloading     would like   add bixby   this list   why don   build   phone powered   android but running customized   microsoft itself   also   cortana can read reply messages from the phone why not link that api   process not sure   those are the words needed for   idea   the messaging app that comes built         and also   will   great the microsoft expands   services internationally like for example cortana which   barely works   regions outside the       hope that microsoft pay attention   this and   something because   would like   see them making its way   the mobile department     all microsoft apps should   native   the phone and you should also build     mobile text messaging app that sync with the messaging app   windows   could you please increase the maximum size   better remove     all   because   this   would like the functionality   only execute the selecteditem code when   row   doubletapped     proposed solution     add   rowdoubletapped event directly   the uwp datagrid class itself     would like   add   animatedheaderedtextbox control   the toolkit   get back the offiline symbols download   would     possible   enhance the loading control   disable navigation when     running   most   the screen   wide   why not   horizontal layout for colorpicker       developer   want   see the screenshots and logs   customers are sending     via the feedback hub   upon   person next logging into the device   would   nice     able   have the app restart automatically too       like   see   way for any uwp app   opt     being automatically restarted when the user logs   after   shutdown caused     automatic reboot   having the app receive activation parameters that indicate the cause   the restart would   great for this too     would allow the app developer   track why the app was restarted but more importantly   would allow for the app   provide   better experience that allows the user   continue where they last left off with the app running and     specific position   the app   nav view should   made   full proof solution for developers   nav view should   more integrated   the application   that the app   consistent   this info should   mandatory imho     would   great     could have two webview each having   different user profile     command like   settings utilities would   very useful   for example   isselected property could   added     treeviewnode     function like selectnode treeviewnode   the treeview     ever event handler must   like one touch behaver   user     think microsoft should add   new property   fonticon that combines fontfamily and glyph into   single uri property call   glyphuri   further   think nuget should maintain   set   tags   all their properties one   these tags should   font icons   that when you click download new font its going   search nuget for this font icon tag and list the packages for fonts from most popular   least popular   also   think nugut should maintain user comments for each package and   star rating   that people can get   idea   the package   any good without installing   could you add the link for the feedback hub   the store   app review form     believe that the app review and report for developers should   divided       possible   add the note   the review form   following     need   open the window   maximized   please provide   way   configure the size   the window   the launchuriforresultsasync method   take sample from here https github com microsoft windows iotcore samples tree develop samples serialuart     run application and set breakpoint readasync method after line     you are also using pinvoke kernel dll please install the nuget package directly   the uwp project automatic references added   other nuget packages like pclcrypto add   older version verify the version   pinvoke kernel dll   your bin   debug build output folder   should     least   microsoft should give   the possibility   download created app packages for failed certification processes for further debugging   suggestion for pathicon datauri property for loading pathicon from   svg file instead   specifying messy vector strings nobody really wanted   put this stuff         their xaml   another possibility     allow datauri   point     text file holding this type   stuff         would   nice   you could drag your file from the project tree over     xaml property requiring     appx path and   would expand       appx path instead     fullpath   the file   your filesystem   this would   well placed   the task manager performance tab   dedicated usage graph could   displayed for   activity   would   nice   you could set the height     textbox using number   lines   and   can   made backwards compatible with height property   pixels   also heightlines should automatically set acceptsreturn property   true   make   super easy   create   multi line textbox   xaml     also think there   something   little bit weirld about the textbox control   you specify lines height   should say lines   height and not expand box   should just beep when you get   the end   the lines   course   would   line   they built the scrollbars into the control then   would auotmatically scroll when exceeding the lines but     leave that for another complaint after they add   lineheight property   make   work the way people want     work   the reason why its   good idea   add   heightline property   that   allows everything     done   xaml setup the fontsize fontfamily and the pixels size automatically   expand   match exactly lines   from now onward please add sync methods first and optionally add supplementary async method for long operations   they are   welcome addition   the api but they should not   the only way   obtain data     would   good   have   option   xbox device portal   that   can see the javascript console logs like network logs   http monitor tab   also   would   great   there     option   inspect and debug   for example   can add some text   anything   please   the side instating how far   this point   the current gps location     webview   can   panning   moving with fingers and zooming   pinching smooth and fluid     think   should take   one step further and make notepad opensource like powershell   the open source community can continue   add features   notepad   become the     text editor for performing quick edits   programming     would   useful for notepad   update from being   win app     uwp one     keeping with current   strategy   bringing cross platform apps   the windows store making notepad one   these would   extremely helpful     would   convenient   have   selectedbackground property for calendarview   please check these links where users discussed similar issue   inputpane should not   opened and closed again and again for each input element   there should   option   preventing auto hiding when getting focus through tab button   inputpane just like preventkeyboarddisplayonprogrammaticfocus which   also not working   uwp target version   enable   application developers   easily use   volumetric content   xaml composition   configuring spatial scenes and manipulating transforms and skeletal animations   add   panel that allows   create   design with constraints and support   blend     would like the ability   filter the call stack when trying   trace   function call   essentially make     searchable   the solution explorer with the ability   add some exclusion rules   bring webview with edge   wpf and winforms applications   and now that           iam still playing and building but   mother and her friends cant keep   with windows they are having   hard time finding there way around windows please give them back the old windows that they can navigate   now that windows has lte support rcs messaging api should   introduced     can take advantage   this messaging protocol   our uwp apps   attach devices   another and ensure   full loading   hot unplug and wait about     now   idea all controls could have   default property for localization     attribute could   used   identify the default localization property for   xaml control     might   placed     menuflyout     button     appbarbutton   maybe   least   using the simplified folddown mode panning other file formats could   supported     webb for hololens running apps section should have   column that tell the user account under which   app process   running     would like   ask microsoft developers   fix this issue and provide couple extra degrees   freedom going through the rdc     think   can support this   adding   simple constructor that takes   the same parameters   initialize   add loginhint   optional param   loginasync and plumb through getusertokenv async       would   great   have access   this values   stay   track with actual developments from other vendors   introduce functionality   that mac address can   obtained programmatically   another possiblity     add   attribute   button called     custom tiles are being displayed get the watermark   associated with them   since   are passing   string via the   bind attribute   some   controls   would   nice     could make the binding     readonlyspan       avoid allocations   you could rename the windows mobile   windows watch and you could stop making the lumia mobile phones but you could start making lumia smartwatch with windows watch     needs   work   good   the one available   winmm dll   please add   semi automated test queue mode   driver verifier where you can select   group   drivers and then have driver verifier test them one     time moving down the queue one position with each reset   reboot     automated test queue would   wonderful     situation like this   please look into how musicians and developers use midi and what   would like     able     with devices like the surface and prioritize giving   the ability   innovate here   the swipecontrol control should support mouse input   well   touch input     personally would like     able   have   similar arrangement     own apps but currently   unable         resize the windows explorer window   something like           fix   just resize the window     bigger proportion   the screen when   not fullscreen and then maximize   again   add   option   let user         might make sense   have that option   task manager since     the tool   control startup tasks   windows   adding   image editor   captureelement control with these options ability   save captured image   predefined image types jpg png etc   how about   option   automatically delete the automatic checkpoint when the machine starts   add store uri schema like   windows store assoc appext     search app extensions     would   useful   this feature can   supported   windows     want the screen setting       option where   can set   preferance     default         great     could chain functions together     bind   create more complex expressions   rather than writing   specific function for this purpose       nice     could   composed   individual pieces that can   combined   many more ways     would   good     could submit utility tools   the store   there     way   perform these tasks without admin   maybe warn the user when downloading the app   more stringent verification process for these apps but don   block them completely   you   hurting both devs and users   with the publisher   the manifest locked   the developer name   well this should   implemented   make uwp apps much easier   distribute outside   the store   please improve the app submission process for internal beta testing   provide   lock   the tiles   that the tiles won   get collapsed accidentally   button   right click and left click   the touchpad   continuum control display   mobile will   very helpful     have more than apps   the store and would like   see all downloads   these apps     number   but   hope   suggestion will   passed   where   can   the most helpful   the first feature   wanted   suggest   that   believe cortana   lacking certain capabilities   apple ios specifically the ability for cortana   send emails from the cortana app directly   outlook for iphone   similar   how cortana handles text messages   would   nice   cortana could draft   email onto outlook for the iphone   the second insight   would like   provide for feedback     the cortana   speech recognition   apple ios and android and user input   however   would still appreciate being able   see   text message notification   have received     iphone from cortana       not just wanted for gaming but for business apps too   suggestion   the returned storagefile class could not provide the actual entry   the choices selected   the user maybe the filesavepicker could     with   read only property   method after the user confirmed the file     could try again   develop great software again   many years before which your customers want   install themselves because     just fun   work with and   brings great benefits   users   the could start with small things like this feedback form which   annoying too   trysetwallpaperimageasync only supports   primary display rather than allowing the wallpaper     set for any attached displays   add   switch statement for xaml which allows app developers   modify parts     layout based     value     would like   add the functionality myself   contribut   somebody could help       think   needs   provide more support for schools thinking about cloudbook using windows         like   user voice where   can request certain software   added   the windows store       like students     able   install scratch and sketchup for example   but   would   good for     approach   reverse based   school feedback   update apps same time   ios and android updates theirs   include gestures that could allow users minimize apps for example with three fingers   please set some heat sensing app   default   your windows before     too late   set   multi alarm software   that   can cope coming world situations   let   make   different type     which can understand and not only communicates with the user     would   extremely helpful     could create   custom dictionary word list constraint     can already with speech recognition     was possible   the old microsoft ink api   please add windows update   default rules   please   hamstring windows and support process isolation for containers   please allow that api     background   microsoft should   enable the windows bridge for android   get public tweets without user   authentication   take any xaml page add   button     and bind     any normal     not   command   the view model   compile the app and the xaml compiler throws the exception   with proper hooks many different scenario variations could   achieved   let   say there     app which display news stories       opinion developers should not have     this   prevent multiple unintended events from   control     need   fix   ensure that the contol stops forwarding click events after   has been clicked multiple times without manually adding code   each and every async handler   closing the streamsocket   disposing deleting   should stop all the pending asynchronous operations reads   writes     would   nice   there was   api discovery endpoint   adding visibility property   expander and making the header invisible will make the panel looks like     sliding into the view   allowing uwp access packaged com will eliminate this overhead allow simpler architecture and allow   use much more traditional win apps     you really need   fix the xbox app store     the very least publishing   xbox should     opt   function when publishing not   opt out one     would   nice   you also ported the ads into uwp apis   that they can   used with desktop bridge apps   please add wmi support   uwp   these apis ought     allowed for any uwp application but are most useful when working with runtime code generation       like   see   api   create virtual midi ports built into windows   the surface touch screen has tons   possibilities     midi controller but this currently requires installing     party driver which   not   great end user experience   built   rtpmidi would   nice too but   least this would   achievable without   kernel mode driver     had virtual midi ports   allow uwp applications   tick   box   the appxmanifest declaring       full trust desktop application   prevent full trust apps from targeting phone and xbox   you have             issue virtualize the registry   with the desktop bridge   look the concept   uwp apps can run   your phone rip and your xbox while admirable isn   practical for most applications   show   notice   users upon install more     would   nice   have   attached property for scrollviewer   set middle click scrolling   code would   useful   adapting   bluetooth applications   check the create date   the file   wait one minute   the clock shows   new minute and the run the code again     you   into the explorer and delete the file and create     explorer with the same name the create date   correct   following the comments   the blog post for   unix   would   nice   see sock seqpacket and   sock dgram support     would like   vote   have this feature   configurable   settings allowing users   disable this feature   please add support for cryptuiwiz api   handle timestamp reply   can   the reason   revocation   extended execution     little more specific than systempolicy applicationclosing applicationsuspended     uwp project follow xaml code make   win exception when minimum target   build   allow copy paste   settings pages for path instructions and especially   failure error outcomes for self repair fix research lookups       possible   disable suggestions   the settings but   guess apps should   able   disable this themselves   will   possible   share the roadmap   the lcow improvment   grouping another optional feature   enable grouping   basis     string property   the items   search bar   top search bar attached   the control which can   enabled disabled with   boolean property   one   the problems   here   unity code which   mostly made     single instance but   would   great   have support   launch multiple instances   the same app       like   add itemclick event   the carousel control     able   use     item listing control with the ability   click   items like   the gridview and listview     please remove this restriction     this     privacy constraint then please consider   add   capability that can   declared   the app manifest   based   this   also could notify the user   first app start like     done with the camera access   markdowntextclock should provide linkcommand alongside linkclicked event     would   good   textboxregex will   automatically delete letters   input like the textboxmask   maybe   new validationmode type would make sense here   can you add the   viewer object that   used   paint   and mixed reality viewer   include the mouse and keyboard support   make   available for net wpf also and via nuget   please add   overload   create   mediastreamsample from       surface   but   would   even better     could configure the compiler somehow through   special screen   the properties   through   optional configuration file     such   configuration   could enter for example default binding modes for specific dependency properties like for example twoway for textbox textproperty   get rid   the emailmessage body character limit     you have such limits publish them   the api docs   the aforementioned forum post suggests using   remote api     work around   please give developers the option   not participate   the upcoming sets feature   recommendation contentdialog should   the locking   that the user does not have       have   dialog that can   used   any time and that always shows centered   the main window   the app you must have two copies   the dialog one embedded   xaml and shown using inplace but only       loaded and the other not embedded   xaml and shown using popup   recommendation add   parameter   showasync that positions the dialog relative   the main window   the app centered left right bottom   since only one contentdialog can   shown     time   lock   needed such   semaphoreslim     sequential queue   taskcompletionsource   but   would   nice   choose what elements get discarded first   case there   isn   enough space   the tile   when declaring   custom template for contentdialog the template root must contain   border with   name container otherwise the showasync method will throw   system accessviolationexception       propose   download archive for windows insider preview sdks where   can download earlier versions   the preview sdks   the expected behaviour   that when you click   the primary   secondary button     contentdialog then focus should   switched   the button concerned otherwise   bind bindings wont update   please make registration posible for moldova   please extend keyframeanimations scalarkeyframeanimations   makte them pausable and resumable     mediacomposition add transitions between two clips   timeline         think     good   rotatortile has   indicator which shows what index   selected   maybe another control that can   attached   rotatortile   the panorama mode   beautiful and   only   could have   button   call the api from inside our apps   would   great   that   why     suggesting   specialized textbox for numbers   allow entering negative values   allow entering decimal values   format the text with   specific number   decimal place           suggesting   textbox with the following feature     should return dom element and coordinates and   case   image also the raw bytes     least receiving scriptnotify events should   possible   http and without adding applicationcontenturirules   manifest   that   could atleast have   way         our own   switch the default     style line endings   the whole operating system   there are situations where you might want   interrupt navigating away from   page when using navigationview   please provide this same information   the usage page     would   nice     able   specify   itemssource and automatically populate   with mvvm     short   need   uwp alternative   showcaseview https github com amlcurran showcaseview   there should     machine learning sdk smilar   apple coreml   uwp should include   augmented reality sdk simlar   apple arkit and google   dev kit   could you add this   the list   uwp apis supported   desktop bridge     really need     able

please add allaccountsreadwrite   userdataaccountstoreaccesstype   order   allow   creates calendars   remote calendar providers   provide funtionality similar   currentappsimulator class found   windows applicationmodel store namespace   another solution could   simply extend office store   order   publish vsto add     please add reveal effect   each item   the listview   the hamburger menu control   per creators fall update   the possibility   make optional packages plugins with code for   process with  # and     net instead       when   make store listings for several languages   would like     able   just right click     listing then copy   and edit not   troubled with details   cvs and excell   also would like   see when exactly   listing was updated   please add   uwp ble api methods   interrogate ble stack connection settings   you may wish   consider   flippdfviewercontrol for inclusion   the toolkit     would   good   see support for setting   gridview inside   listview which has the ability   add columns     your are not able   suggest   folder   file   the user     path string   what would   helpful     have   service   the toolkit   get   azure   token   having access   the visibility   the system back button   good but there are some scenario   where   think   would make sense   have   disabled state for this button which could   toggled   dev     certain scenarios     would   nice   have   way   automate update upgrade bash ubuntu   windows that does not require   start bash   you should update all the constants for the paper sizes for example constant for     business card and pos receipt paper wasn   stated but you wrote other sizes are being reserved   please allow generic classes     base classes   xaml pages controls   obviously   would expect   point that neighboring files should still   available but maybe slightly slower   allow winappdriver   switch context from native   webview   imagine writing text directly into the textbox   richeditbox canvas without the ink keyboard overlay     the way speech recognition should   handled the same way     come   all the apis are already there give windows ink   boost   would     lot more intuitive useful and less distractive then the current overlay   please make sure the   invoke either points     windows api allowed   uwp applications     native dll that   part   the package     for some reason your   invoke does not satisfy those requirements please use dllimport exactspelling true   indicate that you understand the implications more   move from onedrive sdk   microsoft graph   add msal support for   auth model   could this not also   provided   the uwp toolkit for inclusion   uwp apps   add   custom calendarview control with more personalization options than the one included   the sdk   individual calendarmonthview control   that   you want   display standalone months you can maybe you display   grid   months etc     think   first case must   fired

possible   locate   the other three corners     need backward compatibility for xaml just like android for example   can just use navigationview without any conditional check   all   please add support for composition visual   handle pointer interactions     would   nice   have   uwp   xamarin community tutorial where devs can contribute   the tutorial and make       date   create   cordova plugin   enable ios and android hybrid apps   use project rome features     would really like   switch   uwp for development however     not able   elevate users   install   uwp app that win apps wouldn   have any problem just downloading from   network drive   and also   full screen   would expect transport controls   ignore safe area   could microsoft not add   padding reflecting the core window bounds   the full screen window only instead   manipulating   grid   name     want the transport controls semi transparent area more   add tumblr service too     could also   able   start tracking packages directly too   consider   full screen application where you   like   temporarily control that brightness   please extend the api   run   desktop and mobile devices not   embedded mode     would   better     was   fast   the webclient class used     desktop application   both problems could   solved   adding groupstyle itemtemplate   and virtualization could   optimized   well   using container cache per group   imagine   image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images   folders must   course use   very different item template than images     want   see   better windows store first where   apps can   found   please give the highest priority   improve app discoverability   windows store   apps must   found   keywords     would make sense that the app   published   the private store and users who have not been allocated   license should have the ability   request   license rather than just getting   error message   for events the target method must not   overloaded   add   control that reminds users   rate your uwp app after   certain amount   time   app launches   depth tests are needed for fast skipping occluded pixels and depth reads   the shader are needed for calculating particle opacity   make them soft   set depth writes enabled   disabled set other state changes make the draw call       opinion the     dsv read only depth   really useless and should   removed any state validation for reading and writing   the depth texture should just check for     depth stencil desc depthwritemask   each draw call   however   don   sacrifice performance those validation checks should   performed only   debug mode     setexceptionmode     raise flag driver internal error and   that case the draw call should still   allowed but   only should issue   debug warning writing   depth and reading from     the shader may produce undefined results   you should trust the application   let   manage the correct state changes   its own without introducing artificial limitations and sacrificing performance   this would result   smaller memory usage faster performance smaller cpu overhead power usage longer battery life   you will don   have     these checks   this artificial requirement   removed from   api   add ability   conditionally trigger   keyframe animation from   expression animation   order   support more complex animation scenarios   cam     need   service status page with   have issue     working       already have the pulltorefreshlistview   the toolkit     can also integrate this functionality into the control and change the name   something more suitable like listviewex and have both   the functionality     single control   please make the control usable     app   make   menu with information about the files being locked     application     would save   tons   space   only have one small svg for   simple icon rather than   dozen large png files   add eyedropper ability   pick color outside   the uwp app   there should     form developers can fill out   request expedited review     would   useful   this limitation were removed allowing physical web support     developed using windows alone without

the cer file contained   the apppackages appname version test folder   your system cert store unter trusted roots   something must   wrong with the uploaded appxupload package   this package does always crash after side loading       this crash   not the problem reported   the certification process   now things are very complicated   the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain   the microsoft certification server which generates   package which fails   startup   unfortunately there are   more details available from the certification process   also microsoft support could not help     they build   package which fails without details and   can not download the build package for debugging   fortunately   does not try   start the build   part   the certification process       was able   install the test flight package     local machine for debugging   using some gflags and     was able   find that the entry point for formatmessage was not found   the problem here was that for some   releases the   program files   windows kits app certification kit supportedapis     xml file contains some entry point definitions for formatmessage which does not exist     the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash   startup   but why was   working     local machine   this   because     using visual studio which has already fixed the problem   unfortunately the build infrastructure   microsoft which   used for the uwp certification process   least for our targeted   version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version   the supportedapis     after   used the latest version   pinvoke kernel dll which contains   workaround for the problem all was fine   local

done please make sure developers   not remain   the more     was working with webview   display static html and   found   issue   the   table tags are displayed very small   size   you can check using below example   the wns currently does not seem   support loc key loc args apns equivalents       result all   the notification strings have     generated server side iterating for all the languages

case while apns gcm provide   single cohesive story   this gets even more painful when   work with client application teams that want   customize the localized strings for their platform for   loc key loc args contract   this gets even more painful when   work with client application teams more   currently the xaml engine   uwp does not manage complex control attributes since   does not take system componentmodel typeconverter into account   that   why   can not write this simple xaml user code   where the complex property   begin and the complex value   that represents   position         the way that will     lot simpler than the wpf   typeconverter   after having tried typeconverter   uwp   tried   add implicit operators casts   the complex type position here from and   string but xaml

audio files     would   nice     able   assign   compiled binding   properties through the visualstate setters   xamlbehaviors   please add   delegate version for the propertymetadata create where the dependencyproperty   supplied   you can create   default value for the dependency object instead     simple default value   please bring all languages   cortana for iot because are needed   create devices for interacting people from around the world   provide semantic animations like fadein fadeout crossfade etc   should also   this for other converters for same behavior     white background scrollbar should     different color       fully visible     could   really good   hot reload the app when changing  #   xaml code     would   great   add   property   choose the direction   the progress bar clockwise   counterclockwise   when notifications are removed from one device they should   removed from all devices   default     know there are   plans for running uwp apps   windows but   designer would   nice and would virtually remove the need   upgrade   windows before writing apps for     aside from   personal dilemma     missing device   would definitely make sense     able testing code     emulator first instead   having lots   hardware around all the time     microsoft fears somebody could use the emulator for playing games       then just turn off games   please create actualstartlocation   fileopenpicker   that   can open the file selection dialog into the exact folder   want   please add   api that allows   read the temperature from the device       please add the ability   access the rendering pipeline   the mapcontrol class     would   great   the application executable launcher exe element   the uap extension category windows appexecutionalias element would allow     specify arguments   the appxmanifest xml file     why not include enablepulltorefresh     property   masterdetailsview     would make developers life much easier   they had   possibility   access files simpler       opinion     create two new controls   one   textcanvas for display and editing both text and inking     would   great   the roaming folder quota was larger than       least this would prevent   from having   depend     network paid service   have great cross device customer experiences   this   not really completely uwp related but microsoft should provide free virtual machines   all windows versions for testing purposes       experience uwp   really fragile and could make   app behave differently   every version     you think that you could make the windows store and other built   apps accessible from the device portal making     lot easier   install new apps that are already   the store and make changes   settings etc     would   great   something similar   dependencyobject setcurrentvalue method from wpf would   introduced   the future   that   dependencyproperty can   set     new value without missing   one way binding   can you please expose the viseme events for the windows speech sythesis     think   would   useful   have   the toolkit     would   great     able   bind invoke scripts inside   webview from   viewmodel like binding   url     property   symbol enum should   updated with latest segoe mdl asset collections     the enumeration are updated with the latest mdl glyphs   may helps many   developers who search the correct glyphs   could you please add selectranges ienumerabel itemindexrange itemindexranges     able   add multiple ranges   once and also make selectedranges property   only get set     able   replace existing selection ranges   after releasing   refresh the list should animate back   top     simple list   and while awaitng for the data     fetched the refresh indicator content should   visible   have   property   control its visibility   would prefer this one     would   even better     could have   api that could make the calculations for   and offer     packet failure retransmission percent   average time between send and acknowledgment   optionally the worker side   async awaitable should accept notification uri   conjunction with type which the type itself may   may not exist   the target   execution   which case   can decide   create exception instance   return typical http message the important part   the contract   return notification should   extended   the application developer     way that allows   harvest its result     expected format potentially   polling yet another resource   but either way please   make   api available   providing thos apps would boost uwp   platform and thus create more possibilities for users and developers together   please allow private developers   access those capabilities     hope everyone can publish fonts   the store     would   good for developers   specify auto renewal   the durable paid add ons   developer portal   users   not need   repurchase the add   again and again     toolbar stacks items from left   right and   would   great   have such   toolbar   uwp like   have   today   wpf and several other desktop programming models     you build     would   great   you could add configurable close functionality   the tab header that   bindable     viewmodel     think this could   made simpler   support for example   headerstyle property   the pivot   maybe the dev should   able   define the panel used for the headers   for   classic desktop application   need   tabcontrol       suggest that you bring the hierarchicaldatatemplate   uwp   please increase the limit way     remove   completley     you add files from across the filesytem which         app letting the user drop   images and videos from any location you could rapidly hit the files limit   increase futureaccesslist limit like   millions   introduce userchoice dialog   accessexception   raised   also     secondary request let folderpicker suggestedstartlocation also     folderrelativeid   optional show   user input dialog requesting access   the file   folder and let the user decide   please add   trigger   start   background task when   nearby nfc tag   recognized     would   more convenient for the user     app could react   the nfc tag even when the phone   locked   add system tray support   that app can   minimised   system tray   you need   provide corewindow minimise api   this case   allow other formats than pcm and float for   frameoutputnode created with createframeoutputnode   class audiograph   this burden would   eliminated would   frames   available   the frameoutputnode   other formats like     ogg would   nice     must   possible   only unload main   out   the process without terminating the app service   allow changing   volume   the windows device portal   please add the old silverlight pivot control   uwp toolkit   can you please add   iap which would have   recurring payment automatically charge user monthly annually etc     would like   add   function that automatically loads the lyrics   the song that   played right now     solve that   would   enough   have read access   the system media transport controls data   other apps     could   interesting   provide   control   generate and show   power   chart inside   uwp application easily with   control     code     would   useful for creating more user friendly battery related apps that provide better experience for example   refreshing tile   sending notification   the event not some time after   happened     can also change lock screen background   however   would   useful   get more flexibility       could put some templated   custom notifications   would save     lot   work and make lock screen more user friendly   provide more rich api for text rendering without need   use low level direct   for rich text rendering capabilities       also   happy   maptilesource property changes like bounds were applied   the map without need   remove the tile source and add   back this   how   can   done currently   compare the   usage with google chrome for example   maybe   default the way   looks now but   should have   slider that   magnified   the user taps close   edge   the list and signals its intention   use more   there   should     way   include secure data   strings   byte remotely   dev center   app setting   there   should   way   revoke secure data   server which would require   publishing app with new set   keys and app with revoked keys should fail   access   secure storage   this data should   accessible from secure key storage immediately after app install and keys should   installed into secure key storage   part   app installation process   provide ability   deploy   update   certain users only     would really   great   there was   control which allows   move forward   backward like the microsoft edge browser does with touch input   touchpad input     should work like   horizontal listview   gridview   you can normally scroll through the listed items but when you hit the end   the list and continue scrolling the edge like part should kick   and navigate you   new   old view page list       love   control that would     sibling   listview   gridview only   was backed       canvas instead     itemsstackpanel   allow the placement   rectangular items         optional bonus would     allow the user   rotate the items   the look and content   the items should   course   customizable     would   extremely helpful     able   create mediasourcestreams for audio streams   the vorbis and   opus formats   dockpanel should   ported   windows xaml   currently store access from windows   either enabled   disabled this really needs     more granular       should   clear nullable properties   xaml should   supported and not give the error cannot assign   nullable type   property   please check and fix this bug       causing frustration   xbox users   for   personally   would   much more convenient     able   enter   privacy policy content directly into   text field when submitting updating   app rather than having   provide   url     think this should     option   allow     use runtime arguments for windows applicationmodel fulltrustprocesslauncher launchfulltrustprocessforcurrentappasync   addition   the parameters declared   the manifest     short you could add something like this   your manifest file       case   would also   happy     was possible   add verbs   all file types but this   something   could live without   merging them into   single installer would benefit our users greatly     seems   order     that   need   either pull out   the store   convert our desktop app     uwp and merge the two installers     would   great     have   option   disabling the overpanning behavior   scrollviewer with   api   with any other option   disable     net standard should   used   uwp and not limited       because only simple values are supposed     used   navigation parameters this suggests that   third party software component must exist for managing the sharing   complex objects between pages   evidently this     limitation   the mediacomposition saveasync api   should   fixed       radio apis are brought     would   amazing     could get rds support   well     believe this should     user based permission api   case the user doesn   want     have this ability     would greatly apperciate   these apis could   added   uwp         fantastic     could   possible   access such data from the converted classic apps       app   currently playing audio   would   nice     app could control the experience and interact how   would want     outside   the system experience     would like   control have   app control the vibration haptic feedback setting   just imagine connecting your phone     display device and building uwp apps       can   the next big thing for developers because   developer wants   carry     laptop wherever   goes     would   cool   have   option   remove the border and caption   the window     can make non rectangular windows just like with gdi and the layered windows api   please expose the directx com api   uwp one having the api coming from microsoft would     much better guarantee than relying   third partys     house wrappers   subscribers   the backrequested event should   notified   stack order instead   queue order   example   the uwp community toolkit the masterdetailsview control needs   listen   the back requested event   handle navigating back when     collapsed state with selection     would   great   user and dev could modify alarm volume   the best   would     also dev could set volume granularly   each toast notification   user might want lower volume for morning alarms and louder volume for alarm used during busy day   let the user choose between spit screen   anaglyph red cyan   the only workaround   far     write the text     win wpf application and then copy paste the text into the appropriate fields which causes   serious security problem when working with critical passwords   please add full ldap support query read write   making   possible for     write tests and code once and have   being tested     autonomous way   provide libraries   help   get started with project rome and building   cross device experience for   application   enable linux devices     included     user   device graph   enable discovery launching   apps and communication between connected devices   enable ios devices     included     user   device graph   enable discovery launching   apps and communication between connected devices     would like     able   have screenshots for each and every action for   winappdriver like   had with codedui via uitestactionlog html see https msdn microsoft com     library   aspx for what     looking for     would   very useful   you allow external devices     through bluetooth   control the running audio video   the phone   please allow   set the display language   mapcontrol   one different from windows display language   music app can provide   its users   extended network functionality such   audio streaming upnp dlna   smb cifs   ftp client   get music files from server upnp dlna client   send audio data   renderer upnp dlna media server   renderer     would   useful   have either backgroundnetwork new capability   atleast extend backgroundmediaplayback capability and   playback   active which can possibly   using network communication and app   not suspended keep network communication active   the only option for now would     make   separate pro app   please add   azure developer   for windows with unity   the playback devices and recording devices section should   merged and more info like samplerate channelcount and meters for every input and output should   added with   better       should also   possible   easily select the device where you want   play your system sounds but also   select two channels     multichannel device   you need your average stereo output for most applications   therefore   would   nice   have   option like xsltsettings enabledocumentfunction property   net apps   please add ability   remove azure   association   please add   manage users account level permission show notifications for disable enable this option   adding this may encourage more developers   port their apps   windows from ios and make things more familiar   please provide   api for quiet hours   windows mobile where developers can set the quiet hours parameters from foreground and background     would propose adding the ability for the splitview pane     opened   swiping   from the left side   the screen   would     feasible   somehow make this type   offering   part   the store   the xaml engine   uwp should manage complex types for xaml attributes     suggest   make the xaml engine able   use   interface that lets transcode convert   instance   and from   string   allow the ability   open the explorer and show   selected file   the explorer   that the view   already scrolled   have   file visible   advanced creation tools need   implement features like the eye dropper which allow the user   select   color   the screen and use     the application     would   great   you could request special permission from the user like   notification manager request and that would allow the password manager   fill password forms   there would need     some things that would probably need     specified for that   work such   specifying   username textbox   please add few enhancements     accepts html also   add   converter which may help developers     suggest making this data more accessible   that servers can   better monitored both   track failures and   inform   cloud system   needs   scale out   more servers   new http server and httplistener apis should   added that surface the failures and request queue state     would   great   add new status like closed   abandoned   please set   limit and   you are going   ask for   description make     least   characters long   windows should allow users   freely redirect media audio midi even video someday   guess from   the hardware audio interface webcam etc and   applications even considering the desktop     video audio media generator     could     simplistic   allowing piping apps devices outputs into apps devices inputs through virtual interfaces managed   the user through   piping routing manager gui   there should     native way for developers   omit their app from being able   show   preview when hovered over   the taskbar   well   preventing the screenshot that   visible   the recent apps section   mobile     are aware   the risk   allowing   app   hide itself from the system but   would   beneficial for security software   have   means   controlling any data that may need     hidden     this point   think   might   best   just lift the restriction   insider reviews and also show more reviews regardless   version     the very least don   delete reviews from the dev center even   they   not displayed   the store     can use them for marketing etc   why dont   support adjacenttotopdisplayedge and adjacenttobottomdisplayedge too   make   possible   add the environmentpermission node   the package appxmanifest   allow environment variables     retrieved   add this for side loaded   enterprise distributed apps   desktop devices   set     uwp shell app   test within     the minimum   create   instance     tcp service and add   text attribute with   key value pair     addition   existing functionality which allows   collect dump when app crashes   would   nice   have   option   collect dump   running process   windows mobile any time you want via device portal   add   usernotificationchangedtriggerdetails   usernotificationchangedtrigger background task with   least     suggestion     change the behavior   that triggers   add another pair which will fire   lock unlock transitions   this behavior should   fixed     new property should   made available   the sdk   enable     get the user defined settings for regional format     need   way   have   system wide overlay notification   this could   used   the new skype preview app and would   extremly awesome and powerful   please update torch driver for these devices   need use torch for our app     allowing subpixel font rendering would make them look   par with desktop apps   please increase these limits maybe     opt     keep   mind the limits command elements     command set listenfor entries     command total phraselist elements and total phraselist items across all phraselists             crucial   can remove the close button   complete titlebar from the tabtip keyboard   use file playback sample   custom effects sample   and for the consistency   the   design sometimes   will   nice   allow the app freely styling the buttonsespecially the close button   for example developers can hide those built   buttons and draw their own ones and call corewindow minimize corewindow maximize etc   looking forward   customizable window chrome for uwp apps     example         have files copied   during   build process and would like the ability   write against the     please make all versions the default   can you add   new property   ocr library   that the developers can tell the engine which direction the text was written     add support for ngening   the desktop bridge installation     would   great   mediacontrol supported webm format   this property needs     implemented for mobile   well   enable   true universal app scenario     would like the ability   xaml   conditionally have   xaml output   compile with flags like you can currently with  #     would   more useful     able   sort   reviews acquisitions crashes and ratings   while this could   also   fix for roslyn system runtime csharp analyzers the generated bindings are not the owner   the disposable fields and should just ignore the warnings   please add shell context menus api for uwp apps     simple property   set and get focused item would   appreciated     please add tcp timestamps option support   the streamsocketcontrol class   please add   way   get   storyboard   paused   what would   nice   instead   sending tile notifications for every minute   there was   way   better adjust the live tile image every minute       also love   see better extension entrypoint   integration similar   app     please provide   template for   xaml interop   once   storagefile   storagefolder   allowed     accessed   the user   should   accessible across all those different api     would   nice   have   command line tool   submit apps   the store   launcher launchfolderasync should accept   storagefile   first argument     would   great   have the ability   hide all apps categories   with windows store and only have   show the private app store     would   very useful   add this feature into hosted web apps   that native textboxes     web application can inherit this capability when converted into   hosted web app   please fix this bug once   passwordbox with   inputscope numericpin   rendered the keyboard becomes stuck     number pad and does not return   the full keyboard   the new notification access   awesome but     possible   add overlay   and services you will find   under accessibility settings   android         really want the universal apps   grow more powerful   solution when open     file type association the   least   simple dialog should ask allow access   all those file types     the folder   only that file   camera should work when app   minimized   the idea     segregate the user interface and business logic such that the user interface will execute   users machine outside   browser chrome     standalone application   make   easier   register for   background task   there are   lot   upcoming features   help with fluent design and they are really great however   make full use   these the features xaml controls need     backward compatible       fallback   that apps that   not target only the latest can also use this   please review your package scanning portion   the application   developers should have the option   opt out instead   the option   opt     having   device portal across all the different devices     great idea   please add   api that allows   read the temperature from the device   please add   option   get rid   the fade   animation for opacity   that   why markdowntextblock could offer   way   register some kind   callback function which   called whenever the control comes across   fenced code block with   specified language     all     asking   when   new version   windows   released please keep the old vms still   there     fact   can use     share with fonticon element without the enumeration     would   really cool     could open   tcp   socket and   listening   the raw transmissions and   send events determine how good the network quality     the other side   the task should not even expect   notify someone   its progress unless the platform offers capabilities such   sql server   event windows application event log   some form   notification     would also   good for tracking the causes   uninstall spikes etc     would   nice   for adaptive tiles with multiple groups where the current size can   fit all the groups those groups would automatically cycle around similar   msn news live tile   calendar app but   this case   individual notification would   cycling rather than   queue   separate notifications   also   would   great   have the option for paid apps       subscription   users are charged periodically   continue using the app   some apps could benefit from   easy way   not only send   toast notification but also maintain   notification history users could view afterwards   implicit datatemplates not really   issue   the pivot but would   great   have these     control similar   the flowdocumentreader flowdocumentscrollviewer would   really awesome       had   take ads out     app   make   run and stop users complaining but now that means   income until this   fixed   the control   the equivalent     pivot table   excel you simply add the datasets with labels and the control sorts out all the selection fields visualizations and animations   please expose undo redo functions   the textbox control   that   can trigger   programatically     would like   offer some guides   the user   our own application   could   interesting   have some interesting     able   show   popup that give user some indication   the app     precise scenario like when discovering   page the first time   when   new feature has been delivered   allow   mix two app models javascript winjs html and  # xaml inside one application   make scroll viewers and lists support gestures   scroll   bottom     top   once         menu   displayed and the user moves the mouse over another menu without clicking the first menu would close and the new one hovered over would open     fact   wonder why   does not support this fundamental feature while android and ios already does     you create   listview     html uwp app you can   invoke   item after scolling trough   with your touchscreen   allow the placement   rectangular items       make autosuggestbox supports automationproperties for test automations and accessibility   currently store access from windows   either enabled   disabled this really needs     more granular     think that app should have two ratings one from windows phone users visible   people having windows phone and second one from windows mobile users visible   windows users     the appxmanifest one can only specify the default colors     hex value   there should     option   enter accent   let the default splashscreen have the users accent color   when using   listview bound     collectionviewsource with grouped items   would   great   have the option   make the grouped item selectable interactive   with mouse flyout opens   right click which           have access   the   radio apis   need the ability     app   force audio     through the speakers not the headphones     would like   programmatically set and get the volume for windows   with windows mobile uwp and continuum microsoft   focusing   enterprise customers and developers     think bringing     windows mobile through continuum can   game changer     that   theory our applications could report and find bugs for       should also   possible   easily select the device where you want   play your system sounds but also   select two channels   using the createrequestasync method   usercertificateenrollmentmanager and certificateenrollmentmanager classes   noticed that the certificatepropertiescollection does not give   the capability   specifying enhanced key usage oids for example smartcard logon secure   mail basic constraints like subject type end entity   path length constraint none nor the subject alternative name like rfc   object guid ect     hope you will take this suggestion   consideration since this feature will   very useful and easy   implement   applications developers     course   would   even better   make xaml use typeconverter additionally for compatibility   sake with wpf     already know workarounds using bindings but they are not practical they need more code and they are semantically incorrect   binding   not   transcoding conversion they are different   nature   this gives you low latency input   case     busy   thread     think microsoft needs   boost xaml development       doesn   interest   open source   then the community can itself improve     please revise that value       provide better representation solution   any media audio midi video generator consumer       app     hardware device should   treated     freely connectable node instead     hardwired starting ending point like today   the documentation indicates that   should   possible   provide   environmentpermission for this   work but out   the box running this code     uwp project never throws any   the listed exceptions   you don   specify the environmentpermission   simple usage   the dns   api results   the dns client service crashing   extremely need password protected zipping and unzipping for universal app     would   much like the skype for desktop   small call window that comes   when you are     call         much happier     could just avoid defining these macros entirely   avoid any possible issues     api that would take minutes for someone   write   and save     lot   coding   pedestrianfeaturesvisible cannot   disabled   mapstyle   set   aerialwithroads and cannot   enabled     set   aerial dwithroads     belive     critical   make the minimize maximize and close buttons customizable for building   refined     wpf apps work much better when ngen       liked the previous dev center where   could compare multiple apps   the same graph and just the look   general   there should     way   define them   once       sure making the interface public would save   number   developers   fair amount   effort and frustration     worked fairly well     but now       when you     the start screen until the tile notification refreshes the live tile shows the default app tile     know   can get server certificates from the server once the request   done but   should have     done just before sending the info   the same request   please enhance launchfolderasync   accept any istorageitem file   folder   the first argument   right now   can   able   assign itemssource   mapicon   here map for universal apps please allow   bind   can have easy   implement the apps having multiple map icons loads from database     have   provide different versions   our client application   the same time   converted app   the store   for example     the msi appx   added folder like samples   projects   cannot   found   the open save dialogs with set initial directory opened   the installed executable even   the folder   installed   the installed executable   folder   the new notification access   awesome but     possible   add overlay   and services you will find   under accessibility settings   android         will make uwp more powerful like win and also let dev make some powerful and useful apps like universal copy and native clipboard   there should     option   the busness store settings that   checked will send the updated app   the new lob apps section under manage apps     wish that garbage collection was optional for  # uwp apps   add   easy   use and customizable ribbon control like the ones found   the office mobile apps that scales   pcs   phones   there should     powershell prompt   device portal that lets   run extra commands     should   possible   create visual studio centennial project   winforms wpf win mfc etc which should also allow mixing   uwp code like xaml   with full interop between native and uwp platform   ada has the ability   express pre and post conditions and add them     easy manner   these were     put into the apis you could block erroneous data from being passed into the api   function which   turn should make things more stable     least give more meaningful error messages than               and the like     suggestion   that microsoft create   cordova adcontrol and mediation plugin     frequently need   automate tests that run   different test users   that   can test workflow etc   allow the developer   query windows store with restfull api service   would   nice   have   market place where you can buy sample starters themes and plugins from independent developers   now that microsoft has bought xamarin integrated     visual studio and made   free   would   awesome   replace xamarin forms xaml syntax with current uwp   that devs can benefit from all the new rich features such   relativepanel   bind adaptive triggers live visual tree etc and also   learning curve for xamarin forms specific naming conventions     stacklayout instead   stackpanel       like   see support for having winappdriver log     local file   well   support for setting log levels   would   nice   have   market place   beautifully designed apps submitted   independent developers   please let   know when you will add more payment options   you could consider doing the same     the screen select the features you want   install     select the windows software development kit feature   the bottom   installs   worth   stuff including headers libraries and source code     there     api   access this information enterprise application development with uwp becomes uninteresting   something that would really give the mapcontrol   leg   over esri would   the ability   create   shapefile object and pass       parameter   something like mapelement createelementsfromshapefile shapefile and get   list   mapelements that could   added   the map     least please provide app price conversion list between usd and local currency   think   foreign developers       better     wake   early   since most     don   have   trademark   app names this should   forced   the store everybody will benefit with this developers and microsoft with   cleaner app store   adding disqus   the windows blog would     great way   improve developer engagement and build the windows developer community   this suggestion   for the windows blog and   asking   improve its current commenting system   replacing   with disqus https disqus com   trying   bind     uri will either throw   exception   give   compiler error   can   remember which and certainly won   display   image   you can write your own converter for system uri     image source type but then you have   manually specify the converter   each binding plus you lose any performance tweaks   may have made   their own converter     might make sense   have another method alongside requestverificationasync that allows consent verification via pin   password but there needs       way   request biometric only consent verification   would   great   have these bugs fixed soon   for older browser that   not fully support   the code could   transpiled into     babeljs traceur etc   however   would   even better     allowed users with the developer role   create app packages   visual studio     would expect the store     capable   searching the partial words also   may   give   advance search option where people can tell where the word should   searched   the only workaround provided   msft     manually periodically wake   and reschedule   bunch   notifications ahead   time     microsoft really wants   get into the iot they should really support version with ipv communication over bluetooth   start typing something   the search tab and try   scroll   the bottom most element while the inputpane   open you cant see the last element   how   you intend your surface pro users   keep the surface steady with one hand while taking   look   the small preview and clicking     small button with the other hand     have some great ideas and working   this since some weeks and when   tried   implement scheduling   was surprised   see that this   not available   windows   please make support for setting set automationid   corewindows and messagedialog   another even better option instead   adding the edit extensibility would   adding   open with option   the built   photos app   uwp really needs   way   handle master details situations easily maybe something like uisplitviewcontroller offered   ios sdk   this can give   app the false impression   being able   modify   non app calendar until   save   attempted and fails with unauthorized exception   seeing   splitview     control used   divide content between and pane and content area   would make sense for splitview   allow   paneplacement top and paneplacement bottom   addition   its current left and right parameters     would like   recommend adding the ability   upload screenshots     pixel size   would   really helpful   have findancestor api added just like   silverlight and wpf   back   how   was   the old dashboard would   ideal just   simple link   toggle between visible and hidden     suggest these new maximum lengths title characters description characters same   for app description   you could also consider implementing this partially for example allow inheritance only between managed winrt classes and deriving managed classes from native winrt classes   please modify like this   you cannot submit any app during this period     you have any question please contact support       try   use one   those   answers with   parameter incorrect without any details   nevertheless user experience   very bad   the device state   always unknown upfront   consistency could   ruined   every dev needs   handle manual markup especially   the   toolkit   the whiteboard app for example resizes graphic images with pinch stretch because they have fixed aspect ratios   example code which registers   service using windows dns   apis   for example     want   shut down   take   photo   search for dolphins   want   show the weather   the user   whatever from the uwp app itself   this way the app   very robust and flexible   this way   membership     group changes the license assignment for app will automatically change   reason being       own   rendering without using directx for that video portion     code just locking the screen directdraw surface for     parameters   however there     toolkit available for affinity designer which   the only design program besides adobe   that   available   the microsoft store   the error     error       okay with   friendly warning perhaps   glyph replacement   not only will this benefit both microsoft and samsung but put more power into the hands   the users and developers   both which are many many people   exactly   the title says   besides   will have   broader reach   consumers     wrap this     really have faith   what microsoft and doing and cortana while   needs improvement   can prove       great competitor that what   out   the market but being limited   few regions   just not useful and that sucks     got several user feedback     could provide   larger compact overlay   seems   users would prefer watching   video always   top with   larger size   currently   interact with   datagrid   rows you must specify   selectionchanged event   the wpf grid control had   showgridlines property   this property   missing   uwp     looks that   removes something from the folder but   cannot   after   while the contents start moving but there     way   move   the very top   very bottom using only the touchpad mousewheel   there seems       bug   dns   where finished services are not actually getting unregistered     liked windows version     would like   try   maybe some   the rest   you have       developer     constantly dropping new packages into the dev dashboard   bonus the cancel button   the upload operation doesn   appear   function either       early adopter   the platform   have   number   test apps and   games   some   these users are dirtbags and send   garbage feedback like asdfasdfasdf     also created   few test groups   can   delete   the past   part     exploration   the dashboard   the page indicates duplicate email addresses will   removed yet when   paste   duplicate email addresses they remain   press button show selected view   standalone and app   chrashing   what   the problem       currently using   controller mapper like xpadder and joyxoff with   xbox controller   the latest   update   the hololens   missing key features for the commercial suite such   kiosk mode and others   your recent upgrade keep killing dwm exe which     caused display driver   died   most     don   give   care about apple features   just want controllable situation and not wasting our time trying   delete virus that you recently given         info regarding last update   when you registered with wrong account you need   contact microsoft support and cancel   and needs   signup with correct microsoft account again   allow rotation scaling   mapicons   that they stick relative   when the map   rotated   also would like   place triggers   oom levels but that     seperate issue     would   especially powerful and useful     able   access the dom that     the currently loaded page   the webview control and have full control over querying   and even modifying     necessary     all variations could   merged   think most developers would   able   adjust     and there would   less confusion   the future   the best answer would     simply exempt installed web apps from the group policy defaults for web pages   and our customers would love     able   install these apps without having   install firefox   chrome first   for exemple the close button could     top right triangle   larger cube   the old format   showing     screen shots side   side would give   user   better feel for the app     whole   another suggestion     add another section   the bottom showing related apps   long   they meet   certain review standard   promote cross visibility     would prefer   either   show the app   page   the store     not   included   the results   all     appears   create   error     think you should provide the option   capture audio with   external mic via the   jack and not through   bluethooth external mic   when running   small ssd for your   drive the emulators can take     large amount   space     would   nice   move them     second hard drive   please make the theme beautiful   making the icons     instead

and   want   make   knowledge public    have   uwp app targeting windows fall creators update which was published successfully   the sore previously     new version fails the certification process with app crash   freeze  side loadable release builds are also starting and working   our build and test machines  this package contains our code compiled with the native tool chain  this package does always crash after side loading      this crash   not the problem reported   the certification process  now things are very complicated   the uploaded appxupload package contains the net dlls which are compiled via the native tool chain   the microsoft certification server which generates   package which fails   startup  the same build process     developer machine with the locally installed native tool chain generates perfectly loadable builds  unfortunately there are   more details available from the certification process  also microsoft support could not help    they build   package which fails without details and   can not download the build package for debugging  the test flight certification process builds the same package internally  fortunately   does not try   start the build   part   the certification process      was able   install the test flight package     local machine for debugging  and   crashed   startup  using some gflags and     was able   find that the

this library with the old version    the native tool chain compiles against the wrong entry point which causes the app crash   startup  but why was   working     local machine  this   because     using visual studio which has already fixed the problem  unfortunately the build infrastructure   microsoft which   used for the uwp certification process   least for our targeted   version windows falls creators update uses the buggy version   the supportedapis    after   used the latest version   pinvoke kernel dll which contains   workaround for the problem all was fine   the microsoft build

scroll   the end   the list listview will   disabled for some period   time while data   loading  and   you release mouse button from scrollbar while listview   blocked then some strange behavior

   http www   org   appmanifest  allow changing country and publisher name after registration   the store please either extend the existing class   consider the use cases for the phone   ditch   and come   with something more like apple   approach which works better than what   currently there  unfortunately this means the app     none starter because the files can   several gigabytes   size     kills the user experience everytime they try   open   file  the emulator should support sensorsdk   propose you add   proper unit test suite for the winjs platform that can   automated and ideally run from common javascript tools like grunt  please document how transitions work and expose the necessary api for     create our own drop   replacements for the limited set   transitions supplied   the existing apis  for example         want   use   custom transition   can fake the transition   using animations   the exit and entry     page but   order for this   work   need   remove the existing stack   transitions from the frame because navigation will reuse the last transition from the frame   collection    the very least   need       transition that can   used   prevent the frame   stack from using the last transition   animate the page change  this feature     ask for xaml serialization featureset parity with wpf system xaml    could   better   have search box   windows phone application instead   having     windows application alone  auto focusing the input element   page ready   not working   windows mobile application      developer   should have access   the entire winrt api       building   app for   own personal device  perhaps more developers would build for windows   they can build their own tools for personal use without   many restrictions  this     excellent feature but   would love   see the same tools and support available for the shared project     universal winjs app    would   great   use bower   install scripts once into the shared project rather than installing two copies   the same script into the windows project and the windows phone project    makes sense   disallow universal  # xaml apps installing packages   the shared project because they might only target windows   only target windows phone  therefore there should     problem with installing scripts directly   the shared project using bower instead   installing two copies   the same script   two different projects    would make sense   think that     region language will   used     fallback for all   countries   there       region specified  please implement   permanent fix   the relevant back end systems  also   need   supplementary fix   the issues faced   existing affected users without resorting them   contacting microsoft customer support   restore their purchase   way   adding credit     purchase the app    you add more than   few like the performance     bad that you have   wait for   few seconds after you stop     sure that the pins controls are   the right position  either use the identity version throughout the store and let   change that with the visual studio wizard   ensure that the dev center reads the package version rather than identity version  visual studio   create package wizard allows one   assign   version number however this assigns the package version number    would like some way   that   can have   various devices each with different form factor get the latest build deployed   them all     select number   them instead   debugging simply failing  pubcenter users should   able   decide how much they want   receive when they get   payment    would   great     could decide   receive less money     single payment and keep the rest for the next year  expose   api that allows apps aside phone and messaging   trigger person reminders  polish your new contact manager api   get the maximum performance hence the user not   sit idle till   loads    may   based   number only contacts contacts with email address   filtering only phone contacts other than any social contacts etc  please consider   suggestion   this case please provide   simpler example with   clearer coding    think     good   explain what   default image  please provide support for adding developer user     windows developer account  hope that microsoft   possible allow   individuals   create individual developer account for free and allowed only   publish one app   windows phone   windows store  please add   link   https dev windowsphone com     account summary that links   the password change page   https dev windowsphone com  also add the same live profile password change link   the windows store profile  might   nice   make   easier   find the right password change page  allow background services   display controls   top   other applications    would   great   for example play   video     small square box while browsing the web   respond   messages without having   open   message app  please support     live streamings please please please expand the email signature function   that you are able   include   detailed signature including embeded images    using the fileopenpicker class   can filter shown files   extensi   but   think   should also   able   filter files   their name let   say   only want   show pictures whose name start with abcd   whose name ends with bcd    please provide this option  the dev team should   able   access info through the dashboard  make net available   all platforms including mac linux all smartphones  microsoft could have created more tools for integrating nhibernate easily into net apps but they developed entityframework instead more just like   winrt could   have spell checking options and text prediction   window phone silverlight apps    was working   clipboard manager application for windows and discovered that there     way   catch clipboard contentchanged event when application   running   background seems the life cycle   winrt app doesn   allow this  wish   would have   possibility   create   background task that   triggered   clipboard content changed system event  add webp support     can easily process and export images using the format    want access   every camera available   same tima    think there should     property maybe something like showdeletebutton that allows you   specify whether the delete button   displayed      testing   crucial for quantitative marketing      like   see the ability     order   related apps     can choose which related apps get promoted first   users  let the local apps install without need   access   windows phone store just like exe files   windows  after profiling the app   found that after calling mediacapture capturephototostoragefileasync method memory   not released and allocates   with each call      also voted for this suggestion   that could fix most   camera related issues   windows phone  the only way   detect       looking for unauthorizedexception but that exception   ambiguous    location permission dialog may   showing when   network error occurs     unrelated part   the code for example  perhaps ensuring   year gap between signups would   enough     deterrent   those that may want   maliciously close their account regularly  please include   country yemen   pay out and advertisement too  datepicker should   allowed   have   null value initially and not   programmatically set that could accidentally   mistake for   user   input  setting dayvisible   false prevents the spinner from showing which   nice but then the date   displayed when the value   shown   the field which sort   negates the feature    would   nice     app could provide its own tasks todos   the        alot   copying and pasting and would really like   see   customized copy and paste built into windows  that way when   paste   still have the other files   memory   paste elsewhere      can copy like say different files folders   would   nice   have   selection when   right click and place   mouse over paste   would like   see   paste all paste select which would have check boxes   each folder file   have selected   copy  please provide apis and support   ibeacons technology and also ble scanning without pairing just like using advertising package   that   can exchange data     from target device  replace most used tags attributes with number  all the developers needs       some thing like this    you think about productivity this   not   way        allow changing the country and name after registration   windows phone store pubcenter and windows store  pubcenter ads should not play sound unless clicked     have   way   mute   sounds  allow developers   add suggestions   the user   wordflow keyboard  you might throw     messagedialog   the catch clause    would   nice   have   showforasyncaction method   something   that you have one call and don   have   worry about cleanup    would   nice   have one thing with three states rather than two things who have two states each  developers need   write additional code using the deprecated directinput api   access those devices even though microsoft states that use   directinput should   avoided and xinput used instead for any gamepad functionality  there should     update   xinput api that will add functions     migrate and simplify that functionality from directinput  you should also   able   undelete   app package for hours after you delete  you should also   able make   backup   this information       does get delete you can always restore    for the testcase source code see below  you should officially support windows template library wtl and make   the first class native windows api framework replacing the aging mfc  please release compiler sdk and tools for developing traditional desktop windows api and mfc and net application   arm windows   devices  this capability   needed for third party apps also  now since cortana does this already please pass   the parsed nlp string with identified pronouns with grammatical breakdown  all localization should work like resw files work   there     entry   the app description you should revert   the original entry    would   great   windows phone will support access   contact   groups  allow   frame   frame capture from mediacapture   that developers can more easily create streaming protocols without having   relay   the ugly and poorly documented media foundation api for trivial tasks    had unlucky case that   app was refused   the tester though   his screenshot you can see that   got exact message   why the app   not working     required proper text   speech     installed  bring back support for ipx spx     the very least provide compatible drivers either through the microsoft website       legacy feature that can   installed   windows  currently need   generate   bitmap image which not works well for list etc additional payment option such   paypal should   added   allow people who owns visa card with advance features   register for dev center  everything works well the button   visible and   says choose file however   you click the button nothing happens  please vote here   enable photo upload option   webview apps for windows phone suggestion introduce   system with trusted developers who can release apps   quick and easy       now  please create properties for disable scrolling pan and zoom and auto ressizing the webview      like   see windows api   command prompts file explorer support   much longer file path    feel that     important     able   minimize the commandbar   windows phone apps because there   limited screenspace   even something like the commandbar can make   difference    like the ability for apps   connect   the people hub and show items   the news feed but there are some things that are really annoying   consumers and could   solved with   few apis    suggest some apis for the app   attach some actions   commands   the item that the user can invoke straight from the people hub       cool that the facebook app can show   news feed   the people hub but     annoying the fact   have       the facebook app     something    suggest some apis for the app   attach some actions   commands   the item that the user can invoke straight from the more   need   background task system event   update the wide tile and the lock screen message when the device wakes   the lock screen becomes visible   windows phone universal apps  visual studio should allow built   gpu programming for major brands nvidia amd and intel    think the credentials needs     deleted with the app uninstall    would like   have   option   buy   app     game and send       friend     gift like       steam  please extend this     the maximum time that the bluetooth spec allows between pings   maintain   connection which   seconds   atleast make   greater than seconds   that very low power bluetooth devices can   made  microsoft should include   good   for the dashboard and   make some arrangement   display total downloads   the main page like that   google android dashboardthe windows developer dashboard   simply boring stuff     love   have better and improved reports   improve   app and tune the descriptions     app store listings aso  for this   hope you could add the uninstall rate usage how often how long   user uses   app etc  either allow   set   different password   remove the password     like   was before      show download percentage please add   feature allowing developers   know the amount   remaining submission credits    would also   nice     could request those credits from the dev center   also suggest that voice   text   allowed   write this there should     windows tool   convert android xliff strings   resx format within the windows phone sdk with support for mcc codes enable cortana      press the search key and enter cortana   notebook   pressing the icon   the upper left corner   the screen  allow more specific queries   appointments  platform should support new applications that are not big companies  also     like the rating   the app   allow     the developer   respond back   the end user ideally emailing them and   posting   online and allow them   correspond with     try and resolve any issues whether that   with microsoft being   proxy   whatever makes sense    suggest   create another option that alternates lost   signal and bad signal  create   infinite loop that breakes the connection     random time      ability   the emulator that can emulate   bad data connection     can discover performance problems before our clients receive    well   think that the devcenter app should   updated extended   that the app can show the windows store apps   well   the phone apps which   currently does ideally   should also use the live tiles   show the current stats   your apps  suggestion show exactly that error message   the windows store dashboard    single line should   through all the months regardless   the release     least   should   able   turn that filter     off  please send more information   app before removal   suspension      asking whoever checks   tests   put more information   their findings rather than giving the developers generic policy numbers like    when utilizing the file picker and specifying one   more extensions the dialog that gets shown   the user should filter   these extensions not show everything but only have those items selectable  let people inherit from easingfunctionbase because microsoft you   not have infinite wisdom and the predefined list   easing functions you give everyone doesn   have the one   need  please expand your search range     least the top apps  please update the windows sdk and windows app certification kit   allow     use win prefetchvirtualmemory function http msdn microsoft com     library windows desktop       aspx   think that having and iap price point   could   wildly attractive   end users and get more purchases for developers      like     able   ping for nearby devices running   app using peerffinder but while the app   not   the foreground  would     practical   make     that   user could authorize proximity tracking   the background   that   app could utilize    make possible   add   range   list mapicon   make   faster and optimized provide computer vision apis that would allow developers   get access   functions such   motion tracking facial gesture voice recognition egomotion structures from motion and object identification etc  pivot and panorama controls should have options   enable disable wrapping  also the scroll viewer should have options   disable overscrolling effect  please cant   have   option   the wpappmanifest file   untick fast resume and allow   apps   not run   fast resume mode just like      microsoft should provide   better beta program for developers and user like the one   android   which you don   have   download   separate app you update the stable one   the beta   the store  allowing   prefetch     allow the developer   optimise his   strategy    will   useful     can set the reminder tone   vibrate   that not every reminder would beep when you       meeting    times you may want   set   reminder and let   vibrate   your pocket still giving only you   notification instead   beeping out loud when you don   want      for one   our products   need   support nfc card reading writing with existing devices and several types   cards mifare   ulc calypso desfire maybe even more    could create those folders   each project and bring   the classes pages and user controls from the original project  please add recent places   suggestedstartlocation   fileopenpicker api    would   much less frustrating for windows windows phone developers   have hints sent with the certification failed reports which make   easier   tackle obvious issues that arise because   the restrictions   windows windows phone  please implement the httplistener class   that   can run rest based controls similar   xbox smartglass for our own apps  let normal http uris     able   send notifications   the app using the window external notify and not only the https uris  give the power   the developer   decide     page   allowed   use the scriptnotify event   not  and   only wish     format   datetime like the user wants   see    please give   ability   run background agent and collect name   the current application   foreground  could you please add programmiatic printing   the winrt api  under wpf     possible   initiate printing   the default printer   simply calling print     properly configured printdocument object    order   print the guests must leave the tailored kiosk experience and interact with the local print dialog  while this   possible with compositionsurface   feel     needed   the image control   well  the lockscreen text attribute should   separated out from tile attributes  could you please have   report that includes the prices before the final payment    need more control over the device   childrens activities can   regulated  once your app activates this mode users will not   able   see notifications access other apps   return   the home screen until your app exits the mode  make necessary conditions   that developers choose proper representing application high quality images   application symbols   store matching modern     would   good     can   least optionally reduce the speed   the emulator   better reproduce real world devices  technically everything went smoothly but when   tried   submit the update   required that   reserved   name  please provide access   calendar api   customize the day styles basing upon requirement     like   way   access the deviceextendedproperties specifically the anid     windows store app  everything   fine   until that point but   you want   serialize that class   that you can store   and load   directly instead   traversing the filesystem and opening   each file   read its   tags every time you open the app which can     lot   unnecessary work especially for larger libraries     you can send which book   play     audio background task you really don   have many options    proposal     api out   storagefolder   retrieve   storageitem given   relative path from that storagefolder    suggestion   that when   payment   being processed this should   indicated   the financial report which include the expected date   will arrive and the exact amount being processed    would suggest you look into admob adsense reporting for inspiration       very convenience and everything   developer want   know about payments   easily accessible    would   nice   have such   api   winrt     don   have   resort   native directx each time   need something more than   couple   shapes  what   want   the ability   record those alongside system provided etw events   that   can see how   code   activity fits   with system behaviour    would like   have better access   lockscreen   that   can completely customize   which includes how the time   displayed any custom content like photos   news wallpaper    should also allow   timer based updation  obviously there should probably     pin requirement for first use set   trust but the nfc capabilities   the   platform will never   fully realized until   simple tap can make something happen without user interference    think this     bug because   think   the writeablebitmap decides   update the pixelwidth and pixelheight property   should also update the pixelbuffer   the data   inconsistent  make multitasking   real thing like seeing   video   having   mini calc when browse some thing  live tiles are fine but   need   true way   make tiles more dynamic and that would   accomplished with   widget application template      similar way   the new lock screen apps allow developers   create   app that runs inside   tile   larger dimensions that then current pre defined tile sizes  the app should have full access   touch events   the tile     can respond   them  allow apps   act   data sources for other apps  build   wcf   allow   phone app   app communication  allow json and   xml   pass data between apps  make apps request permission the first time they talk     new app then let   happen   the background    need   brokers   enable copy and paste scenarios   universal app   phone and tablet    need real background download broker     can have torrent   custom download scenarios some   them may not apply   specific form factor    need windows phone   synchronize its clock via the internet  include   api   add remove deactivate tracking protection lists tpl   further drive down data usage enable selective protection against rogue sites tracking and just having   sense   control      better   developers can start their app from background   mean one develops   app that has permission   start itself when   receives   notification    understand power consumption     consideration but   more balanced middle ground like only allowing more intensive background tasks when the system   plugged   and   giving users clear indications such activity   occurring liek android does   its notification bar   that they know why battery life   being impacted would make the winrt environment much more useful and   turn drive adoption    would   great for   permanently running app   have   api which notifies   when   update   available   notify when   update   forced   permit the app   check for   update easily and also   permit the app execute the update  would become even more useful   say   could share   reading list from chrome extension   mac desktop   ios    need the pivotviewer control for wpf and winrt please    think that   wise addition would     create   universal search platform that when enabled   single tap   the search button will bring   only   search bar and with that the user would search for content inside the app and   content     talking specifically for app content      use this xaml definition   work but the groupheader   not wide   the listview  with maxnumberofcolums you can limit the number   columns  win applications need     more productive for businesses  allow xaml winrt apps   change the lock screen background    would   much more comfortable     able   read the entire notification   the center   notifications for      responsible and give more specific details why   app failed rather than pointing   policies which talks about several things    with css   would   very useful     could set text based framework elements     uppercase lowercase title case etc with   texttransform property   xaml  please remove that validation   validate according with   tax plan and not   country   the account  the point     make the app universal across devices   that our engineers   not have   spend too much time learning and relearning the controls  please allow windows phone file folder picker   have access   onedrive and store the location   futureaccesslist  also please allow onedrive folder     stored locally like winrt  because   windows and windows phone universal app     hoping   adapt the app   windows phone   well  make   boot fresh each time phone   restarted   double files with nothing   them   play then error  prompt all users with   warning that they should make sure that the vpn   disabled before proceeding including most users who have not enabled   vpn   the first place and popping such   message almost every time the app   launched    write large portions   code   native code and use the winsock apis instead   the winrt  make bing vision lens   the camera app pinnable   start for quick access again and   add     the cortana screen   the left   the music search button perhaps  please add the from   options right after download new email under each email account   specify when the phone   allowed   check emails  the online media extensibility   fantastic however   would   better   you allowed more sorting abilities for albums pictures and videos    would   good   there was more sorting either via the photo hub   via code which allows all items     sorted title creation timestamp last updated timestamp ascending descending  pleas allow   the wmappmanifest   selection box   force legacy resume mode       app can function just     did      however there should   more   swipe gestures than the tap methods    set   difference   swipe   the right should launch settings menu     swipe   the left launches the apps list  plesae implement windows applicationmodel suspendingdeferral   idisposable probably already declared   isuspendingdeferral and call method complete from within idisposable dispose   simplify its usage  hey   thought   would   really useful   users could add   homepage   their internet explorer for their   like they would     desktop     apps could have custom keyboards   more fun ways   inputting data could   used  for security reasons     really like   see   option that   the high quality backup via wifi   enabled and   the phone   not currently connected   wifi then the phone automatically creates resized smaller photo and uploads   via data   the cloud and then delete   the resized photo from the phone  when you connect   iphone     mac you can view the webview from safari   going   develop debug  with frameworks like angular node jquery etc becoming more popular   really need means   debug our apps   provide the best web experience    would like     able   pull   bing news search results for   specified keyword android has third party apps that can block your apps games with   password    would like   get short videos   fullscreen instead   picture   lockscreen    hope you like the idea   bet many people would like   have spinning earthwind blowingriver streamingwaterfallsetc   their lockscreen  therefore   you want   detect horizontal swipe manipulations     vertical scrolling scrollviewer for   custom listview item horizontal sliding animation implementation for example   simply cannot   done      opinion     essential   have true multi touch support for standard controls   least   universal applications  please extend song class with more useful properties such   lastplayeddate addeddate  but why not allow       used locally   sideloading   through the emulators    would   great   you would add   remoteid   the calendars    think there should     casual genre section     lot   apps don   fall into any specific section already listed  for example timer and alarm apps    would   nice   more recent reviews would have more weight   the total score   the app  please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving   another podcast and coming back    would   nice     able   render xaml that   not   the visual tree and perhaps     background task    should   able   use descriptive text overlays   our screenshots   allows     better point out what the screenshot   showing  for some reason entering   number with     the front     the dialler task     app           results   the message please enter service codes directly from the phone   keypad    would   helpful     able   launch the calendar for   specific day       tell the user you have   appointments today would you like   review them    would   cool   allow the applicationbar   have more icons available    would   also cool   allow for more than one application bar per page   you could specify one   the top left bottom   right  when will the alarm feature   implemented   winrt   support the phone    would   greater     could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing   the storage   similar  please enable removing language code from the dev center language history   should     option   remove the   language code from   app language history     option   completly replace fully replace the prevoius   xap    getting the geolocator   actually   something requires getting the magical and undocumented setting   properties correct and then attaching event handlers   would   extremely helpful   the reminder alarm api supported creating   reminder for specific days   the week  the trial feature should   built   with automatic enforcement user prompting disabling etc just         the windows store  contrast this with the windows phone world where the developer indicates trial mode   the store but has   manually track the number   days since install whether the user has purchased etc  when submitting   app the store submission process should prompt you   link   documentation for any uri schemes your app includes   the manifest file   mark them   private uris   you don   want   document them  currently the best place   find documentation for uri schemes   the nokia dev wiki http bit   nokiaurischemes but this information should really   available though microsoft  above could save hours spent   reading wrong answers there need       business app settings launcher native   the api  there must     way   handle this kind   problem like statistics   how many times   app was started   not being able   start applications other than some basic apps  currently     when there     embedded video     webview and the user presses the fullscreen button the video expands   only the extents   the webview which isn   fullscreen   the webview   surrounded   other controls  there should     property   the webview that controls the fullscreen behavior such that     possible   fill the entire viewable area   the display with the video and its controls  have   api for   application   interact with and listen for incomming connections from paired bluetooth devices while   background    will   very useful   user can scan custom   code from other screen   poster from phone search vision function and launch app via associated uri saved     code    http based api with   program friendly logon     oauth would   most welcome  there     good reason for not allowing this   please add    everyone   the usa has nice upload speeds possibly but not worldwide and   presume microsoft would wish   enable developers from other countries also     able   use their dev center  just remove the timeouts completely     least increase all timeouts     factor     least its not   big deal   implement      step further making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people   use the support system  set     brokerage system whereby the developer never sees the users live email address and instead replies     proxy email set   per user  trial feature should   built   with auto prompted and disabling just like the windows store      possible   create   traffic counter that can show how many traffic   have   wifi     gms lte  the reminder function   the   calendar must   expand   more weekly options  similarly this idea could   thought through for integration   one note with other native applications like camera messaging etc   would   very useful     able   prepair   mmscomposetask   the same way that   today could use the smscomposetask    would like   create   app   monitor the time users spend   other the apps enabling enterprise customers   optimize   user   day   analyzing time   applications    would like   have   option for each skydrive folder   make them available offline    those folders could   downloaded completely   the phone when         available   access them offline later  windows should allow additional user accounts added   track review the application review process similar   what apple and android apple stores allow  please   have competitive advantage   would like you   provide   expedite package for app certification for developers who wants their apps     published fast  having users enroll their phone using the same mdm client   matter the vendor     nice idea  can   have   api   enroll the device through   app   allow mdm enrollment   initiate through   browser download      developer   would like   have method   defer app deactivation suspending   order   call async methods easily   you are concerned about security reasons   good implementation   this api would     always notify the user that   message from that application has been sent and where   was sent    now need   add extra code   reposition     the top after   has been loaded      suggest   include all transactions   the report  all uesr want   find fast their contact when they must call       very good   insert the fast search   phone dialer     good that the user can choose the better method   search like name   and surname   and address etc    think     good that   apps can access   the list   installed apps and can decide   unistall   freeze   lock etc  allow downloading   submissioned xap files   windows phone application publish submission process  please make kids corner     another account  atleast remove password for kidscorner   make another password for kidscorner  allow debit cards     payment instrument for registration and renewals would   great   discover service hosts   local networks  provide   automation toolkit   enable developers   walk through   series   steps and take screenshots   relevant points then   run those steps   different languages   automate the process   taking screenshots   different languages for app submission  would also   helpful       own right for general localization testing   verify that localized strings have messed   layout      developer the only way   increase app ratings and review     prompt user    was expecting some notification center   the site   that   can see what new things have happened over   account since   last visit  let     able   see the reviews that are added   app crashes   that   attention towards them grows infinitely large    want     back   stiill works     that   can set   color for applicationbar icons  isn     better   allow developers   change their app name inside app store according   different language and culture  this would   very useful   the resource constrained environment     phone   allow more code     shared across platforms and   would also   nice     able   retain some kind   unique key the app could store   some other way the app can have   way   query     items that the app created    shared key chain   share data between the apps this help   apps with features like sso include support for pen input like   the surface pro and surface pro for both   and   make   possible   optionally declare   function onclick for live tiles such that this code   executed when the live tiles   presed without leaving the home screen  allow the phone     used     mini presentation device  this can allow the phone     used     secondary display   project the screen contents   for example push   devices   widi receivers please make   possible   build   apps  the app should have more advanced options for scheduling when and how often   will run   the background perhaps   setting   different interval for different days   the week   times   the day     specifying the time until   will run again each time   runs  users should   given insight into how often   application   running   the background   they can decide which applications are worth allowing   process   the background and which aren    furthermore the second duration should   expanded     least seconds   account for larger data transfers and slower network connections  this   also   capability that other mobile platforms have and   think     needed   build quality apps with   good user experience  apps should get   least seconds   background processing time   complete such network transfers and process the response      opinion chinese app are mainly design for chinese and handsets are mostly from china market its may   challenging for developers   get phones from different countries   regions  having said these   propose such feature   prompting       language pack installation       the windows phone   level when user switches language  having said these   thought   feature for prompting user installing language pack done   phone   level would   good  provide access   playlist api     able   create auto playlists based   the song library   the phone      use diferent datatemplates why not make every panel virtualizable  for example   would love       gps app could turn location   when the app starts and turn   back off when the app exits    developer should have   option   tool   manage that list and select which ones are displayed  under this suggestion the developer should   unable   manage   modify the base standard images this suggestion   only for adding additional images  the windows phone emulator should include the ability   manage   snapshots for windows phone images    you want   load content after you reach the end     list you have   write your own user control   create data bindings    navigationservice navigate would let   pass   parameter   type object along with the uri   will help     keep less states objects   the app class which will become   mess   project grows  please provide   photocroptask that takes   image byte and provides the same crop tool  include   pixelheight and pixelwidth   optional parameters     aspect ratio can   included  this would allow for picture cropping  provide   api   that allow apps   either control settings   being able   toggle wifi when nfc tag   interacted  also   would   nice   there was   api that allowed   app     integrated into the settings applets instead     standard app      like   see the windows app store   similar   google where   can skip the hassle and headache   certification and just get   app   the store   hours not days  allow   developers   renew our expired subscriptions      asked the support they said   that   have   create another subscription with another live account and after   ask them   migrate apps and related data      not healthy   keep several accounts that means nothing specially ones that you just had   create because you need   renew the subscription please provide any idea about background service       gps tracking automatically    windows phone   any faith   its future   needs   lot more support from the development team    you want people   develop apps you need   offer   dev platform that doesn   only run   the latest and greatest machines    miss   control like the integrated photo viewer   show photos   any controls page   page   using flick gestures    should     option   remove the   language code from   app language history   you can publish   update with the removed   language but this update will not fully replace the old version and you will   truble    think placement should   splitted   horizontalplacement left center right and verticalplacement top bottom   have more flexibility    would like   have   reminder system api that allows     know   the phone   near   phone from   friend

this might require you   create   simultaneous accounts  note that   you have   store account the apps from that side will not transfer    would   great   there were specific classes that could

the margin   gone  nevertheless   would expect   less hacky solution  having   safe area within   media element   transport controls when not full screen   definitely   bug  and fiddling arround with

progress updates every   which   not really accurate      noticed that pausing and resuming the download accelerates the update rate   about every    this would allow     easily use different itemtemplates for each group   conjunction with groupstyleselector  there are many cases where you have different kind   data and group them   data type  imagine   image viewer where you have one group folders and one group images    you display search results for various item types   one view      possiblte   achieve this right now using the normal itemtemplateselector   listview gridview  but   causes   context switch from native net and back for each item which will slow down the control when showing   lot   items this   noticeable   slow devices   phones  plus     read   the docs this can degrade virtualization performace   the control does not know upfront which items need which template  now the control does not need   call selector for every item speeding   the control     writing this feedback   desktop bridge because   think this team   the innovative and will     better job   communicating these problems   windows store team  desktop bridge attracts       developer but windows store puts   off  currently the only way   find programs are   you type their names  there are   keyword searches  this has been like that for many years but   one has done anything about      you wonder why developers are not jumping     something   attractive   desktop bridge this   the reason  there are many threads   internet discussing this issue but windows store team doesn   seem   listen  otherwise the private store can only   used for   house apps   free apps    content control that enables the user   use inking   enter text   textboxes including richeditbox  each javascript app that uses   video element   the   and calls the play function   stream the video preview from camera   the app page will crash after recent windows update  this crash occurs   all javascript apps that use the mediacapture api   display camera video previews  for this reason apps programmed   javascript that use video   photo capturing are from now   non functional   windows  according   the documentation     possible     bind events     handler  when working with parameters this works   long   the parameters have the default names    for the calendarview selecteddateschanged event the following signature works  this behavior   not found   public documentation  but   couldn   find any option     dev center account   support this functionality      you can   read and write   the same texture and that   fine   can live with that  however the api was designed that   will introduce severe overhead   the following scenario  these objects are semi transparent alpha blending     need   draw them sorted   distance   camera back   front and not   state changes  let   assume   have objects which are soft particles    and objects that are triangle meshes    both   and   use alpha blending    don     depth writes but they   depth tests and depth reads   the shader      depth writes and depth tests but they don     depth reads   the shader    depth writes   mean the     depth stencil desc depthwritemask   both   and     legal operations they don   write   the depth buffer and read   the shader   the same time  however   the worst case when   and   are ordered   the following way    have   change the depth stencil view using omsetrendertargets for each draw call   set the same depth texture but with view that has     dsv read only depth enabled   disabled      order   draw them all   have          understanding omsetrendertargets     slow operation but   need   call   times  and the calls   omsetrendertargets are really useless because the same depth texture   used just with   different view and because both   and     legal operations they don   write   the depth buffer and read   the shader   the same time     don   need   create depth stencil views for each depth buffer one with     dsv read only depth enabled and one with disabled     don   need   call omsetrendertargets for each draw call where   want   change     dsv read only depth  but   just stick   normal depth writes     depth stencil desc depthwritemask this artificial limitation   also the cause for bugs   webgl   chrome firefox  once you start working   webgl     edge you will notice that you will encounter the same problem because   gles webgl     legal   read from the depth texture while     bound   the fbo and you will have     checks for each draw call   depth stencil view needs     changed   have     dsv read only depth      say   have objects   draw    don     depth writes but they   depth tests more see github issue for more information and scenarios

there are heaps and heaps   really good developers outside     who really want   contribute   making windows phone   preferred choice   please microsoft make   simplier and make   digital     would   really helpful   for example   developer makes   app that takes advantage   the schedule alarm api and would like   enable the user   select   custom ringtone for that alarm   this api proposal would enable the user   select from many ringtones already available   the phone and save developers the trouble   having   implement their own custom ringtones     you try   copy paste multiple recipient number   the   box   the messaging the   until the last number will   duplicated   even     developer   can create most   the apps for individual users that   standalone       need   target corporates then then   would need more apis for device management also like zune for   single user   would need   enterprise server application which can control the devices   employees remotely where   can apply corporate policies   the device   well   make some usefull app that run ussd code   please allow the access   gmail   todo list sync when   google account   added   the windows phone   under calendar   see the todo list   hotmail and   like     would   great     can add the gmail   ones too and have the ability   make changes when sync happens   just have the ability   add todo items and those get sync   the phone     the biggest icon size requited     bit   the marketplace single app page this   resized     losing quality   you can   add update delete alarms   reminders from   backgroundagent         great       least has the ability   change edit reminders and alarms that were created   that app   and   want   get that response     app   hanle       would   very useful     able   change the names that   apps appear   when   check the app hub dashboard   developers must   given additional enumeration values   socketype and protocoltype   create variety   sockets like raw sockets based   icmp igmp etc   allow   create alert and reminder from background task execution   allow orientation horizontal     listbox   would like   use the selectionchanged event handler   create   menu using the listbox control     the heading says provide tools   prevent users from reinstalling apps rather than buy the full version and stop devs from being deprived   purchases that they deserve     half the point     app   the information   the live tile     like   have   polite reminder show every   often   they haven   pinned   but   simply don   know whether they have   not   disable the feature entirely   detect when there     screen shot attempt     can programmatically not display obscure   watermark our graphics   like android   need phone level events like sms received sent event camera   off event phone turned   off event keypad lock event etc     would like   phone remote   windows   once   application   installed     there should   some way   run that application without user input       specifically   will want the ability   have selective enabling   application features   that when the   are run after server side conversion     newer hardware they switch   the newer profile   barring that   least allow for merged listings for   and   versions   that customers have   clear upgrade path for the same application     you could just support the native sdk direct             take that over the previous two   barring that   least allow for merged listings for   and   versions   that customers have   clear upgrade path for more   the concept explains itself well   below blogpost winrt transitions creating fast and fluid metro uis http www scottlogic     blog colin winrt transitions creating fast and fluid metro uis   using vodafone gsm and the used data includes unicode characters thus whole message   failed     could imagine that   the same way the sms icon   shown   the lockscreen   mini app icon   shown aswell from apps that got notifications facebbok whatsapp   add   option   delete future appointment   calendar and preserve previous when used the option   repeat   platform should provide access   call log   you can create applications which for example retrive unknown numbers from call log and find their information from public directories   the customized unlock apps are very popular   android and symbian   hope that   could   the same         the moment there     relation between companies and countries         for small business but what about bigger one     have several dev centers   countries and extra sales offices   more countries   same time   registration intends   must use country only   these descriptions also appear differently depending   where they are being viewed web zune       device   the update description field has   documented purpose but then   the forums   read that this field does not appear   the marketplace   please provide   way   predictably introduce newlines into the description fields let   see how these fields will render   the different environments wysiwyg show   how the update description will   used     updated app there does not seem       way   control newlines   the application descriptions   the marketplace   please provide   way   predictably introduce newlines into the description fields let   see how these fields will render   the different environments wysiwyg show   how the update description will   used     updated more   quicker way       the bottom   the metro screen   view tons   pined apps     currently develop for android and ios       interested   developing for windows phone but would need   device   pay registration and learn     platform         that involves   lot   time which     large risk   smaller development companies     microsoft created some incentives like   free device blackberry did this and   free year   membership amazon did this   could drive   lot   developers   the platform which   crucial   the platform taking off     would jump   the opportunity   adapt   apps for windows phone   microsoft created incentives for     try the platfrom   cant use keyboard   landscape mode   some app   you would finally   able   add and customize your alert and text sounds     course each app would have permission accepted   user and each app would have own isolated storage for more private     would   nice   see windows phone move   optional vector based icons instead   static bitmaps   this would allow the application bar   appbar   resize   say   screens were added   ideally users would only need icons for the marketplace tile contains the application name and list just the icon for the app list   appbars could   created     and resized   needed     know this     pain   developers that are not designers   have designers but   option would   nice time saver for the future     would   nice     able   delete   cert you have uploaded       like     able   decorate   home screen   pinning   favorite photos directly from within the pictures application   allow users   organize tiles into separate hubs     secondary start hub   can use   store occasionally used apps would   good     automated hub for recently used apps would also   good   please allow the access   phone filesystem     would     great benefit   the developers can manipulate the sdcard resources etc etc     have the eprint functionality apple the airprint   can you not make connection   these devices possible     want   give   textbox   placeholder text   this now requires creating   custom control     want this     available out   the box     and   want the option   create labels for the textbox   provide the access   pictures   photochooser and camera roll   emulator   since the easiest way   get hold   files     used   programs     downloading them from   network   the internet and saving them   isolated storage   would make the whole thing   lot easier   you could   this with ftp   ftp   still one   the most used protocols for retrieving files   and using   proxy   not always   options since some     would like     able   reach ftp servers that       separate network   imap idle for push emails and sync read forward and answered mails plus sync send folder   email for business   very impotant   for all the guys girls over the years old   need   really big clock   the main display   thanks sorry about   english   positioning cursor   almost imposible     should support ussd menu and umb   well   once removed the metro interface looks good from   desktop app but   the mobile phone   horrible   when the volume     the rang the volume does not decrease   continuing   prior post about allowing     explicitly flip secondary live tiles with   tap instead   launching the app this request would allow such   action   explicitly update the tile   triggering   function call     background task   perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action   take when creating updating the tile flip the tile execute   background task   both   simply launch the app like normal possibly with deep toast   that would really make livetiles live which now they kind   aren   and were   far the biggest disappointment when   saw the actual sdk   coming from ios when   did see that   scrapped two apps   were going   release         third was scrapped because   the inability     location tracking     background task more frequently than once every minutes which   sort   the same stale data issue   here   since     user initiated   wouldn   drain more     the schedule namespace ist isn   possible   have access   the media library   play songs user has already   his device please add this function   get access   the media library   another thing     have the possibility   modify the notification wich   shown when the alarm   reminder rings     need   open our application     overwrite the notify   costumize     get   better improvement for the user   extend the api   query phone volume and vibration settings maybe even set them   please provide validation templates for windowsphone controls   however not everybody has   physical device   having those experiences   the emulator would     great addition   the dev tools and resources   would   nice and useful   have email messages grouped   date same   contacts grouped   initial letter   for sharing audio and video there should     very plain possibility   share stuff   already encoded package   perhaps that could   available   toolkit   codeplex com   there needs       alpha test mechanism available   since the beta test versions   recently submitted have been waiting for certification for days there     way for     work together   this     boss   not   developer and has   development tools but absolutely needs   see the progress   development     timely manner     the beta program certified apps     day then this might not     problem             hardly usable     beta test program since our customers also need   see the app and improvements     timely manner     need support special multitasking tasks like voip and       can   create good apps for this services without this api looks   your skype client wtf   ios already has this api     volume   headphone when phone rings while listening     song raise   max volume   multi select   zune   delete albums     create   playlist   read write accsess   email sync settings could enable applications   create custom sync profiles based   week days time position etc   implement soundwave touchless api   the phone for touch free metro   microsoft boffins showed how they can use audio via the speaker and microphone and   dopplar computation   detect gestures without touching the screen     want   use that   the phone for some games     the submission process publishers should   able   check   box for apps that are made for individuals   older and   older   this should flag   feature   the marketplace when   app   being downloaded   verify the age   the downloader       you can add multiple accounts   different types live google facebook etc     would   nice     allowed   get basic information about these accounts   for example get   list   all email accounts and for each account report the number   unread emails     think there are two ways   improve the beta program   make apps available immediately   when developing   ios using testflight   android   don   have   wait two hours for beta code     approved     upload   new version   have the users download   update immediately     immediate approval   not possible then apps that have been published should   immediately available   when   receive emails saying the beta application   published users are not able   download the application with the very own links provided   the email   users are reporting   day time between when the app   approved   when     available for download   users receive   strange marketplace error when trying   download the application   when developing apps     often useful   leverage existing launchers and choosers   tasks   access certain data   perform   operation   currently this   only exposed for system level data and operations     would   ideal   allow apps   expose certain bits   data   functionality   other apps   provide   complementary experience   terms   reuse   information   performing similar tasks   imagine shopping apps being able   share   set   data such     wish list   news apps being able   share   list   news feeds   imagine having   installed app   what   does best for another app such   perform   series   complex calculations   gather weather data     would   the responsibility   the app   decide what   exposes for data   functionality   this can first   alleviated   with other security screening   prompting the user   allow   app   access another app   tasking features     such case you   better make your videos carefully   that   can leave   good user experience   the potential clients     you convert video   flv flash video which features much smaller size than popular formats your videos will   watched unhinderedly with quick loading   select flv   output format     you are more requirements   your video such   bit rate encoder etc you are   these settings one   one   the pop   formats window   when everything   finished you can click start button   start the video   flv conversion process   you are allowed   preview the converting process   slideshow   mpeg   ect     you convert video   flv flash video which features much smaller size than more   allow the backgroundaudioplayer   play tracks from the medialibrary     allow applications that implement the xna mediaplayer class   run   the background   please add the possibility   add your own spell check service   provide the data     system wide one existed   when   want   build some tiles     app   have   use buttons that   give   custom style   but this   ugly since everyone implements this   another way resulting   odd alignments bad text colours etc     need   simple and standardized way   create simple tiles that function   buttons   beta testers test our apps for free     would   nice   when the app game   published   the marketplace   could include   list   the testers that helped     they can get the app from free instead   having   buy     android ios and blackberry are compatible with this api   why don         would     really nice gesture   have   option wich can put everything   the other side   when left handed people scroll they could also see the content   visual studio and new expression blend   merge products together   add open app   marketplace   the app menu rate review uninstall pin   start     does not look professional when scrolling upward   the end   any page   downward   the top the content   the page regardless   material   application will   stretched down       part   the effect through the whole operating system and does not particularly belong   any application   sometime the stretched content   the page does not look professional     need upd broadcast   search for our devices   the network   when   exception   thrown and intercepted   the debugger edit and continue permits   change your code right while debugging   make the code continue     can allow music that   not copyrighted     accessible   that     huge issue   link   sql   not efficient   all could they include sql sqlight   other library       impossible   connect easily   ftp network   suggest   include     the future sdk     want   office hub that open openoffice document   currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox   recommended   why can     change phone search and   search   google   another provider that actually work   fix bing   fix the phone     best this   unclear but should the user pan   zoom they lose the frame   reference for the place     trying   show them   you can sometimes work around this behaviour   specifying   search for the place you   trying   indicate but this   dependent upon the search results     the search finds nothing you get   pin       the search finds something other than what you intended you can end   with   pin   pins far from where you want them       were possible   tell the task   show   pin   pins     specific point   points that that would allow for   better user experience   even     could just specify   label for the pin that would   better than nothing   add   option private   lock photos movies songs calendar appointments     exit button should   there   all application software     show used volume   you can see how much     your inclusive volume   already used     could just upload   csr and microsoft provide   signed certificate via their own       would   nice     choice between vibration and the sound   given for typing   pin settings airplane mode wifi etc   the start screen   allowing for tester groups   profiles would allow for efficient test setup   the marketplace especially for multiple products   allowing   group     assigned   the app       entered   the marketplace     beta   additionally   would   great   have additional support for enterprise developers that target   specific set   clients   opposed   the public masses   the marketplace   while   the same time providing additional benefits   larger enterprise level corporations   ideally   mini storefront   splash page for the company and product would help draw   clients   allowing for tester groups   profiles would allow for efficient test setup   the marketplace especially more     the app shows sensitive data when deativated   would   good     able   use   different image for fast app switching instead     screenshot   the application   daemon service should   turnable   and off per app basis   the same way like periodic tasks   microsoft should advertise windows phone development apis   visual studio   please make   instead fire   event which could   used   open   app   search bar   page     least support displaying static gif image   back and forward buttons needed not the capacitive back button   please consider   enable support for unsafe code   silverlight and xna apps   maximizing all current main apps would   better than having mil appd   the marketplace   create option   allow periodic agents   run even   app has not been opened for   days   this gives   family     four live accounts       xbox   can log   and play games   problem yet     phone allows for only one user     can   even log     another account   check   edit   let alone play games with       certain rival brand   phones allows users   switch between their live equivalent accounts with   problems whatsoever     bought     phone with gaming   mind but there   more than one gamer   this house please make   possible for several gamertags     used   one device   keeping the message   draft when exiting would save   the hassle   having   type   again   can   have windows phone development using visualstudio lite ide which includes only phone developement   start   expanding the number   apps that can use   certain key word such   childrens stories   that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps   secondly you need   limit the number   apps that   publisher can submit with   particular key word     should have some way within our app   get notify that whether user selected call don   call and when   she ended call means notification   end call     would   more useful   specific service apps could   released that would extend these features   for example adding   google option   the sharing interface   would   nice     power point could have same method     pictures hub for navigation   received from   mvp this week over email   would   great     able   have the emulator location data use the nmea file format either via file import export   using the files directly     feed   other devices use this format and   would   great   see   supported   windows phone   they all use sip     would   great   have   native sip client integrated   also     keyboard would   nice too     want     able   add   picture   the media library and then start the sharepicturetask   let the user see and share   from the pictures hub   remove the apps limit from the phone and app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for   app with   search term   add   quick access block button function     used when receiving spam over chat     would like   see   monthly yearly subscription model introduced that let   charge users   year for   app for example     really need assembly binding redirection   publisher policies   windows phone     would   great   you could add png support   the medialibrary   that   can save high quality png files   the picture library   being able   use simple uncompressed wav files would open   many possibilities for ring tone editors and make files recorded from the microphone ready     used   ringtones     would   great   the windows phone development team could allow     use the rstp streaming protocol   net compact framework   use   provide preference setting   categorize apps   the long list   their categories   app store rather than names   alphabetical order this   extremely helpful for people with lots   apps and provide the ability   maintain the uniformity   the   while making   more user friendly   this will provide more usability   the live tiles   the start menu especially when one needs   drag multiple tiles through long list   please get metequotes   make metatrader for windows phone   need   logger class   log error info verbose and daemon information         available   android   improves the debugging process     displays the certificate signer information but you could easily upload two certificates with different cns service names issued     single   and you would have   way   telling them apart   minimally   should show the   from the subject which matches the service name you provide   client code along with the     the signer   ideally   would allow you   download the certificate for verification     least provide     hash   the uploaded certificate   right now you can upload   unsupported certificate   even self signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback   allow the user     able   set   custom reminder time such   hours   hours before the calendar entry     present you only provide fixed values like       before   tesco club card app shows you points and you have you clubcard bar code avaible   your phone   scan   checkout   apps has your nectar that you are able   scan   stores also shows you your points balance and allows you   shop online and collect more nectar points     would like   button   can click that will only select the countries for which microsoft already accounts for any taxes   support file transfer such   pdf files     bevy   restrictions can also   heaped   the said user control   order   maintain performance and not sap battery life   let live tiles   live please   when   alarm pops     option   edit the reminder should   included instead   having   constantly hit snooze   exit the reminder and   into the object itself     need   posibility   set the keyboard language from code   the focus   textbox opens the keyboard with the german layout the focus   textbox opens the keyboard with   greek layout   true   have tested this and   works fine     the keyboard   not installed nothing changes and the current layout remain   please implement this     important for   for   translation application     suggest   create hardware ratings like ones   winows wei for the smartphone   order   help both users and developers   match hardware with apps   games     think that this ratings will even enable developers   create different versions   the same app pointing   specific hardware     would   nice     able   use the computer keyboard when using the emulator         bit frustrating   type with the mouse     can   use some important libraries   the background agent like microsoft devices sensors that limite our power   creat   good application   currently you can only pin   album but   would   useful   you can pin   single image     tile that way you have easy access         school schedule bus route     picture   someone you like   the current adcontrol crashes any app which uses the silverlight xna hybrid mode   apparently this has never worked nor communicated   devs     normally wouldn   say this   unexceptable but given that silverlight xna hybrid   the new big thing for   this issue needs immediate attention   which   useful   you want   add   appointment with the same time location notes     previous one   currently when you press and hold   appointment   the calendar you have the option   edit   delete   you either have   enter all the info   change the date   the old appointment but that   not ideal because you lose record   old appointments   local scout should show more than just results there should   the ability   state the radius from current location and all businesses within that radius should   shown which could greatly exceed also   searching   company name for   small business restaurant   would   good   that could show within local results   often   try   search for   restaurant and there     result under local instead   have   find their website and then their postcode   this would save   that hastle and make planning journeys much simpler   allow   app   disable text messaging preview   allow users   link their app with the   and people hub directly   now that   have api access   contact information   would   useful   immediately   able   click     contact and open       related app       skype twitter etc   add   full support   regioninfo and add possibility   instanciate one with two letter iso code       can use     dispal country name with user language   add option   hide keyboard specially when you want   copy   long text the keyboard takes around   your lcd space leaving you with   tiny window   work with   exactly   the title says   can you please create   tesco clubcard app   allow the ability   view ssl certificates   https connections     and have the option   install the       suggests   add some kind   storage   store gps poi     addition this storage may have integration with contacts   allow user have geographical map   his contacts   port internet explorer     mobile version   soon       ready   get all new   features   our mobile phones     can build better webapps for windows phone   pls support fixed possitioned elements       like   have tiles   various colours     start screen   allow access   raw data such   signal strength imformation   allow creation   indoor location positioning using available wifi bluetooth   cellular networks when   gps data   available     would   nice   there were   app that logged things that happen   your phone       would   also great   there were   icon   the status bar that indicates that that are new events notifications       like the ability for   application     quick loaded from the right hand corder   the lock keypad     that   not possible allow   button     overriden and pressed during the locked screen process   also   want     able   set the left   power for when the batterysaver kicks     the default setting   way too late     prefer   more remaining before turning           very convenient for developers without actual devices   test their apps for the certification requirements   everything could actually   tested with the emulator   please upgrade the youtube app   microsoft corp with metro   instead directing     mobile site   expose the songcollection class     can add and remove song objects from custome song collections   allow the backgorundaudioagent   utilise the xna framework   that the device   song library can   played and manipulated from the background   you would also need   provide   conversion mechanism   convert   song     audiotrack     the default file type for the bap   relax the restrictions around application running under   locked screen and     the background   unless   course     with   predetermined songcollection such   songcollection limitedplaylist more     need the ability   build apps that are capable   video editing for     please devgroup make this apis should enable developers   build apps that include the ability     video trimming editing and saving   the video library   this   needed   build voip application   playing audio stream   loudspeaker   uncomfortable for users   sir   have samsung omnia   its running latest update   when   charged   phone then the key press becomes laggy and hard   allow applications   define custom shaders   hlsl   this will allow sophisticated game graphics and real time image processing   also allow access     encoder library hardware accelerated   apps can generate their own videos   this should also allow apps   read existing videos modify frames and write them back   for gps tracking apps   there     android app which displays all local wifi connections with their channel number strength and   course name   wpf should have one like this too   currently   can detect and control what the embedded zune player   currently playing   the same can     done with   party apps implementing background audio streaming like soundtracker etc   hello thank you for this site     was very happy     able   scan barcodes from the search button and   would like   use this     application   the design guidelines should   the law   don   allow ugly interfaces   stricter   things like navigation general look and feel even animation   give developers good explanation what they   wrong and enforce good design     something   unresponsive   should not   allowed unless there     clear and good reason for     apps should take   longer than seconds   start and need   explain why they would take longer   make the marketplace   the highest quality out there   support for webgl like the rest   the world microsoft have done this too many times       developers are starting   look stupid years behind   the mobile market ballmer ipad   are just under powered     gates the internet   just   fad enough admit you are wrong early rather than late     much easier that way   the biggest problem   almost exclusively run into when working     apps   the layout performance   silverlight       takes quite some effort   work around that problem   and according   web searches about this problem   felt that     not   lone with this         great   you would work     solution   improve the situation   too often   come across   word     app   might not know     just want   confirm the meaning       colud look     right where     without the need   exit         another app   with this mod   can enjoy the platform more the than ever before     make   the landscape like the upcoming windows   like the original tile home screen from     down   down         address bar should   added   calendar items   give the location   your appointment meeting   this address should   visible   the bing maps showing you the location   your calendar item   vice versa you should   able   schedule via the bing maps adding   location   the maps and linking     the calendar   return back   multi task support may   optional will significal improve advanced users experience     current situation its almost impossible   create some kind   applications such   different trackers survilence etc     color picker control just like the one   the phone   settings would   really useful for apps which want   offer the user   choice   colors     know   can code one but   should   one   the standard controls   the current   mobile browser doesn   support keyup correctly       like   show youtube videos     app     would like   have control over the size positioning and playback     video   there should     option   change the working   these buttons   double click   that   slight   allow for video camera control start and stop recording from the touch screen instead   just the camera button     demo   prototype category like   exists   android would solve this issue       now the number   contacts that can   added     group   restricted   please remove the cap   already music streaming   supported but only for single songs   would       great   add albums   skydrive and stream them directly from there   prefferably the albums would   integrated   the music videos hub similarly   jow skydrive pictures are integrated   pictures hub   all notifications should exist     pull down shade   ios android style   the pull down shade should take   the color theme you have choosen for your phone   notifications should exist within the shade   black tiles and will illustrate the notification type and   short phrase from the email sms text facebook twitter mention etc   have   background agent enable all the time   execute   application event not execute them periodically   ability   add   custom buttons   system call app like   screenshots http bit   incomingscreen http bit   incallscreen click   button will launch some callback which will access     access   call voice stream   out   access   call controls can initiate   new call end exists etc all features provided   standard buttons   call page   currenty when you hit the back button from the folders   the mail app   takes you back   homescreen   please fix this   that   goes back   inbox and not exit the app     addition   the current alphabetical view add sorting options like sort   last installed sort   recently accessed also   would   nice   have   shortcut screen like the fullscreen blue alphabet tiles but with dates day ago week ago weeks ago   doing something like the actual webbrowsertask but with uri pointing   file   isolatedstorage   add   method   run another app passing params   there should     function   costumise the tile depending   mood     the homescreen   tile automaticaly arranged   recent most used favart and latest updated   then   would   better   let   buy internet free sms   minutes   our career codes   let   call codes #   think     one   the most important things here   support for word wrap   something would let   give more meaningful titles   our apps with less app title duplications   the ability   broadcast and bind sockets     port would   handy for making local client server applications where you don   need   specify the server       want   clean and simple interface which works     for example wrote four applications   about two days   getting them all published took   over three months       just not right   the process particularly for someone under the age     getting   dreamspark account particularly now that you   messed   that website and   app hub account   absolutely awful more   windows phone dev   powerless without low level api   access drivers   add features   phone     have developed   app which plays audio using the backgroundaudioplayer         listening   audio over bluetooth and   pause the audio   the bluetooth device disconnects the audio resumes playing     run continous background processing     app frequency analysis   the mic   anyone cares       like   control the priority   this background thread   make the user experience better     note that microsoft bought skype     need   app that includes facebook chat skype chat video call and normal calling   enterprise feature   calendar functionality does not allow for specifying end date for meeting   appointment   bring back reccurrence from   where you could create complex meeting schedules   then   can write   app   simulate   keyboard     mouse and don   need software         sdk give     explorer view for isolated storage   download upload isolated storage files from device   desktop   this will help   testing out and debugging applications which use isolated storage significantly       not possible   send   email with   attachement       when applying for   job     faster way   switch between vibration   and off than having   open settings ringtones sounds     would   nice with   switcher   the volume control like the button ring silent   android gives you the capability   zee how much storage   particular app uses   could really   with this   when ever   make   call   phone   screen goes dark even     not puting       ears   ive read alot   concerns regarding this problem   why shouldn       user   able   see reviews made   people from other countries   here   denmark there aren   that many   users yet     lot   apps will show     the marketplace without any reviews even though you can see   apptracker that there exist some reviews     sell phones with qwerty sliding like htc pro arrive while     not providing landscape for all apps   something between ridicolous and unfair   when you enter   wrong word   the keyboard dictionary     while typing   word   the only way   remove       clear the full dictionary   using keyboard typing settings reset suggestions     need   way   select the word     want   delete   control   send desired picture   native pinch   zoom controller   one line   code   enable native picture viewer with pinch   zoom   instead   having   tap the screen you should have the choice   locking     the top   the screen   tuenti     social network   facebook   spanish   english   catalan   would   very useful for spanish people   south americans   people who have signed         have   integrated into the people hub     have   lot spanish friends who have hesitated   buy   windows phone and finally didn   buy   because their favourite social network wasn   neither   the marketplace neither   the people hub   android has the pull down notification area well   should have   live tile where all notifications come         using   app   its not pin     start screen   can still know when   have   notification   possibility   viewer and writter rar files and native support rar would good job   the built   support for some dpws devices would   nice especially printing   wsd printers   capturing images from wsd scanners would     significant feature   implementing such protocol   not impossible and printing from applications would   welcome not only   developers but   end users   well once available   office applications etc     phone   lost allow remotely setting custom message   the lock screen     contact information     for now the picturedecoder can only decode jpg and run   the   thread       especially thinking about tile generation   background agents     like   have   enriched picturedecoder able   run   any thread and decode png   well   extended ability   highlight text   links within apps such   facebook and twitter for copy paste individual text word highlight     text bubble with the   txts   improoved text edit cursor positioning when highlighting text close   the top   the screeb   too far down the scrolling plays   anf makes   awkward   get   right   wifi data transfer         the ability for applications   follow the data connection   the device especially edge   etc     they run   background tasks with live tiles   most carriers provide limited amount   connection     can able   call managed code functionality   silver light   but   windows phone for silverlight dosnt provide the dll system windows browser   better multitasking with the ability   have background applications     example     playing   game and   pause and want   play later   then   want   use   phone   usual       other apps and that kind   stuff   then later when   want   continue playing from where   paused   hold the back button and   see that game   open   the background not only the latest apps     would   really cool   developers could get api access   xbox live gamertags that way they don   have   make users create   new account just   play multiplayer games     would also help   lot for leaderboards too     you look   all   the most popular programs   any field photoshop office chrome etc one thing   always constant and that     party extensability   bring this   windows phone   all native apps   instead   making   new camera app allow     extend the native one   bring this   all   the native apps including office the dialer people hub etc   tab   usefull   jump from textbox   another         the registration forms using only the keyboard   arrows keys   move easly throught the text   when you have more than groups you need   scroll down   case you want   find   single contact   the     button should open the letter grid   jump   the desired point   the list     would like     work just like the walgreens app   the mango way   switch between tab   slow     please implement   quicker way     that   roll back   the previous     chrome   greater permission   manage the music   help define the current position   the current music with the mediaplayer zune seek position     obtain another possibilities   move   the music   the default button fast forward       windows desktop alt tab   used   switch quickly between apps     need something just   fast       one suggestion   double tap home icon quickly   see the list   open apps   shown currently   this   faster than holding down the back key for some time   zune payer should support custome codec plugin   one can play any format   please expand the messageboxbutton option   silverlight   include   yes     yes   cancel option     would   nice   have   modal control that   standard between applications with additional user choices available   the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened       the last five should   frozen and any more than that should have   restarted     close   app the user should   able   use her his finger   flick   upwards webos style     addition the user should   able   take   screenshot within the multitasking area   using   finger gesture   drag the app towarda the bottom   the screen   screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges   the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are more     will   very useful   you can asign   static     ipv begins     widely supported     was available     and older     would   great   see this included     and later   allow sync     exchange notes   because push notifications can easily   unnoticeable there should     history   the   tile that will also tell you   you missed something   tile counts are nice but   dont have every app pinned nor     want   that way   just   history for one days notifications would   enough     would   really nice   have   share task that   could pass   stream     order   share   image   this task could bring   the same interface when   share   photo from   pictures library     would make   simple   share photos   facebook and twitter   the user already has   setup     would also make   possible   finally share photos via sms and email programmatically   examples google should   able   add google support     people hubs   amazon should   able   integrate their cloud music seamlessly with music video hub   flickr should   able   integrate with picture hub   when searching   the market you should   able   open the app   already installed   please provide apis for call forwarding and other call management functions hold unhold swap conference etc       user   would like     able   select songs that   have put   the device from   library   wake           developer   can only allow the user   choose from songs that   included with the app   the main work around     seen   the various alarm clock apps     force the user   keep the app open over night which   not particularly awesome for battery life   add   option   customize the size   pictures uploaded   skydrive   send via mail   also add   option   autoupload full images   skydrive and not only       preset   the lumia   right now you can start apps   holding down the windows button and saying start appname     would   great   you could start   app while adding some instructions for example facebook show   messages office create new word document prime   mark house season episode   watched   when holding   phone   one hand the palm     hand just below   thumb come very close   the search button and   stretch   far can often send   off   the search function while     texting   writing   email     there any possibilty that these controls can somehow   made less sensitive   become   more mechanical click   the touchmove event   called only once when   move   finger across the screen       can   create complex html pages with   fixed header and   scrollable content     will move the content per javascript but   can not because the touchmove event   not triggered   please implement the whole touchapi   the internet explorer and the webbrowser control   this   very important for mobile websites because iphone and android support this   emails are non editable while   enable picture password     windows   deleting multiple for sms   email services       thinking about   sdk   allow     create   account app     like google facebook linkedin   want   create contacts calendar and access   message hub also writing messages with   account   marketplace upload   this kind should   more restricted   avoid problems   when     reading   web page   other document   would find   incredibly useful     able   jump   the jump   the document without endless swiping     more elements one day     cant see the other       slightly fustrating when one   two screenshots take longer   load and you cannot skip them while swiping through the images   like windows mobile and older version   currently you can only have the review page from the app list with the contextual menu     will   pleasant     the main page   the app   the marketplace   see the general   sentation screenshots the other users reviews   add capability   enter manual parametets for visual voicemail   currently   the all applications view tge jumplist appears only when there are more than apps     have about apps and     already difficult   find   app   think the jumplist shuld   always available     believe scrolling should   improved     sometimes when users are viewing   long document they sometimes might want   skip   the middle lower section   but scrolling seems   take   little long   thus this idea   actually for the developers   make scrolling faster after each subsequent scroll like every scrolls the scrolling speed will increase   ensure that   can buy clips movies and videos directly     without necessarily going through       swipe from the top down with two fingers and flick through the last closed app   seen   windows   for instance email and messaging notifications could   silenced   night whilst call ringtones would function   normal     benchmarking   developer   good developer work     will encourage   developer   design better apps and   makes very easy for customers   choose the right apps ibstead   selectibg some poorly designed apps and wasting the time     see many developers can   benefited from text speech api     can also bring   whole range   new apps for windows phone     android for     google   providing free account and restrict number   messages per day   supporting windows authentication could   very usefull for example writing app that interacts with microsoft dynamics crm   currently only   defined set   extensions are supported for files   upload   skydrive using the new live api which limit really the usage   the api   for example   app can export csv files and   had   rename their extensions   txt     able   upload them   skydrive using the live api   the language should     search critreria for apps and games   the non english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and     hard   find apps     native language           windows phone then make       part   the network   will see all shared resources   one shared folder can   set   phone device   easy   access and transfer   both sides   phone     business feature that would   really nice   have support for   the ability   tie into   voip network for voip phone calls the most common architecture   the sip session initiation protocol       would like the ability   configure   sip client that ties into our voip pbx and phone system       would basically become   desk phone extension   the only way this would really work well       ran   the background like the phone   native phone functionality     there     app developer the   customer lukes       good   see everything that they have made   full   almost entity framework support including graphic class designer and interop with regular   assemblies making   easy for developers   reuse model and persistence classes   the phone without the need   redo all the work   linq and some nasty tricks     would   nice   have the deployment ability     home   able     done wirelessly   this includes deploying   visual studio while developing and using the application deployment tool that   installed   the dev tools   for   the benefit would   that when   don   have   microusb cable handy   can still dev and deploy     phone   try something out   deploy   friend   xap     phone     having     find   cable first   this could   implemented via wifi   course since zune does wireless sync already   even bluetooth once   get bluetooth data transfer ability     lacks usb audio functionality with microsoft sync   cars   bluetooth playing audio   very limited   requesting mtp and mass storage functionality since competitors like iphone are able     all this already with sync     isolatedstorage image file can save   local medialibrary why not record wave file can not   too slow and too little possibilities     took   while until   realized that   forgot staticresource within the style attribute       very hard   create application supporting multiple languages   give functionalities like resource manager   given   ide   other platforms   managing resources and folder structure for them should   made easier   make     for the   player   the moment the volume     really low   curently persons max   please enable pinning   the     settings   start page   splashscreenimagelight and splashscreenimagedark would   great   after that   would   great   have the option   select   image from isolatedstorage   that   app can update its splash screen image   needed   make     that   meteo style app would only need   adapt its     run   windows phone     would also   nice   have   deploy only one package   the marketplace but only the needed bits would   tranfered   add movies and books would     excellent addition for the system   enable speech command   play songs selection   saying play song name play artist play album     believe the single most important thing for windows phone     successful   that users   all countries should have the same services available   now when the marketplace has become available   would   great   users   other countries than   could migrate their accounts   the country they really live     since windows phones are selling hot   countries like india browser should start displaying indian language characters   allow user   set different accent colors for different tiles     should have small tiles instead     long list   apps   which you downloaded like android and ios     app should   able   publish   service that   disvoerable and consumable   other apps   for example     have   app that can process images   want other apps     able   dicover   app and submit photos for     process     would like access     stream for music played via the media library     wish the functionality   access and synchronize the public folder from exchange     the public contacts   the calendar '"

markdowntextblock could offer way register kind callback function called whenever control comes across fenced code block specified language asking new version windows released please keep old vms still fact use share fonticon element without enumeration would really cool could open tcp socket listening raw transmissions send events determine good network quality side task even expect notify someone progress unless platform offers capabilities sql server event windows application event log form notification would also good tracking causes uninstall spikes etc would nice adaptive tiles multiple groups current size fit groups groups would automatically cycle around similar msn news live tile calendar app case individual notification would cycling rather queue separate notifications

well open sideloading everyone would better file json format followed manifest web application standard http www org appmanifest allow changing country publisher name registration store please either extend existing class consider use cases phone ditch come something like apple approach works better currently unfortunately means app none starter files several gigabytes size kills user experience everytime try open file emulator support sensorsdk propose add proper unit test suite winjs platform automated ideally run common javascript tools like grunt please document transitions work expose necessary api create drop replacements limited set transitions supplied existing apis example want use custom transition fake transition using animations exit entry page order work need remove existing stack transitions frame navigation reuse last transition frame collection least need transition used prevent frame stack using last transition animate page change feature ask xaml serialization featureset parity wpf system xaml could better search box windows phone application instead windows application alone auto focusing input element page ready working windows mobile application developer access entire winrt api building app personal device perhaps developers would build windows build tools personal use without many restrictions excellent feature would love see tools support available shared project universal winjs app would great use bower install scripts shared project rather installing two copies script windows project windows phone project makes sense disallow universal #xaml apps installing packages shared project might target windows target windows phone therefore problem installing scripts directly shared project using bower instead installing two copies script two different projects would make sense think region language used fallback countries region specified please implement permanent fix relevant back end systems also need supplementary fix issues faced existing affected users without resorting contacting microsoft customer support restore purchase way adding credit purchase app add like performance bad wait seconds stop sure pins controls right position either use identity version throughout store let change visual studio wizard ensure dev center reads package version rather identity version visual studio create package wizard allows one assign version number however assigns package version number would like way various devices different form factor get latest build deployed select number instead debugging simply failing pubcenter users able decide much want receive get payment would great could decide receive less money single payment keep rest next year expose api allows apps aside phone messaging trigger person reminders polish new contact manager api get maximum performance hence user sit idle till loads may based number contacts contacts email address filtering phone contacts social contacts etc please consider suggestion case please provide simpler example clearer coding think good explain default image please provide support adding developer user windows developer account hope microsoft

crucial quantitative marketing like see ability order related apps choose related apps get promoted first users let local apps install without need access windows phone store like exe files windows profiling app found calling mediacapture capturephototostoragefileasync method memory released allocates call also voted suggestion could fix camera related issues windows phone way detect looking unauthorizedexception exception ambiguous location permission dialog may showing network error occurs unrelated part code example perhaps ensuring year gap signups would enough deterrent may want maliciously close account regularly please include country yemen pay advertisement datepicker allowed null value initially programmatically set could accidentally mistake user input setting dayvisible

show current stats apps suggestion show exactly error message windows store dashboard single line months regardless release least able turn filter please send information app removal suspension asking whoever checks tests put information findings rather giving developers generic policy numbers like utilizing file picker specifying one extensions dialog gets shown user filter extensions show everything items selectable let people inherit easingfunctionbase microsoft infinite wisdom predefined list easing functions give everyone one need please expand search range least top apps please update windows sdk windows app certification kit allow use win prefetchvirtualmemory function http msdn microsoft com library windows desktop aspx think iap price point could wildly attractive end
